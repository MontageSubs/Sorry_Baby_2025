12
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,760
你竟然还住在这儿
I cannot believe you still live here.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,720
嗯 你每次都这么说
Yeah, well, you say that every time.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,240
手都冻麻了 噢! 该死的
I can't feel my fucking hands, ah! shit me.

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,890
我来拿吧 让我来拿
Let me take that. Let me take that.

16
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,660
可重了
It's really heavy.

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,230
是啊 重的要命
Yeah, fuck, it is heavy.

18
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,370
里面是给我带的礼物吗？
Did you bring me presents?

19
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,140
哦 不是 就一大堆袜子
Oh, no, just like eighteen pairs of socks.

20
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,270
这儿有的是袜子
I have socks.

21
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,480
是 但宝贝你的尺码太大了
Yeah, but your feet are huge, babe.

22
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,270
噢! 可真重呀
Ow! It's really heavy.

23
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,910
{\an8}与宝贝的那年

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,530
天呐
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,740
-我是这么想的 -嗯
-This is what I think. -Yeah.

26
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,300
跟男人做爱的时候...
When you are having sex with a guy...

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
嗯
Yeah.

28
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,070
-有时... -嗯哼
-Sometimes... -Mhmm.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,270
他们会突然冒出句...
They are saying stuff like,

30
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,710
“喜欢吧”
"You like that."

31
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,920
嗯？
Mhmm.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
就知道你喜欢
You like that.

33
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,710
嗯 到底啥意思
Mhmm. What is that, even?

34
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,840
对
Right.

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,890
哦 懂了 太爹味了
Oh, that's deep.

36
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,220
我觉得 他们是说...
I think... I think they mean

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,890
说我喜欢...
you like...

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,990
-那玩意儿 -那玩意儿
-That. -That.

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,170
-对 说你喜欢他吊 -或者那东西
-Yeah. "You like my dick." -Or that.

40
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,660
就好像 他们把那玩意儿当成是自己的一切
But it's like, they like, it's like, also their dick is their whole self.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,990
“喜欢我吊吧”等同于“喜欢我吧”
So they're like, "Do you like the dick? Do you like me?"

42
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,190
-“爱我吗？” -得了吧
-"Do you love me?" -"Do you love me!"

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,320
那意思是“用我的吊爱你”
"And I am fucking you with my dick."

44
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,240
对
Right.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
那爱就像...
And sometimes it's like...

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
别
Don't.

47
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,490
或者像...
No, sometimes it's like...

48
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,030
天呐
Oh, God.

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,030
有时像...
Sometimes it's like...

50
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,290
像吧
Kinda.

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,420
-可不是嘛 -像这...
-No. It is. -It's like...

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,430
有时感觉自己灵魂出窍 从他眼里...
Sometimes it's like you leave your mind and you're like, seeing it from, like,

53
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,700
-他的视角 -...看自己
-perspective behind. -Inside their brain.

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,860
看自己屁股可怪了
Your butt looks weird.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,830
有时还...对 哈哈
Sometimes it's like... right!

56
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,290
那我什么时候能看？
So, are you gonna let me read it?

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,670
别急 还没好呢
Yeah. But it's not done.

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,170
连正式稿都算不上
It's not even a proper draft.

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,300
但总归是个稿子
But it's a draft.

60
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,510
可不是嘛
It's definitely a draft.

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,440
还是那种纽约同性恋题材吗？
Is it still about gay New York stuff?

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,600
对 不过这次更黑暗 偏心理化 也很幽默
Yeah, but now it's, like, dark and like psychological, but also funny.

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,730
我绝对要看
I will need to read that.

64
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,930
船来了！
Ahoy!

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,930
{\an9}Ahoy源自17世纪海员打招呼 现多被航海爱好者使用

66
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,370
他在跟我们说话吗？
Is that guy talking to us?

67
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,350
呃 他好像喊了句船来了
Ugh, I think he just said, "Ahoy."

68
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,230
嘿 邻居 船来了
Ahoy there, neighbor!

69
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,940
船来了
Ahoy!

70
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,680
唉 他占了我们的树
Ugh, he's in our spot.

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,440
天杀的
Fuckin' hell.

72
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,730
真想你还住在这儿
I wish you still lived here.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,660
嗯
Yeah.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,790
哪怕住近点
Or closer, at least.

75
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,110
嗯 我也想你搬我那里去
Yeah, I wish you lived closer to me too.

76
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,470
不过我还是喜欢这儿
I like it here, though.

77
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,630
你确定？
Are you sure?

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,850
怎么了？
Why?

79
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,860
压力很大 对吧？
It's a lot, right?

80
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,320
待在这里的话
Still being here.

81
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,880
在哪儿都不轻松
Well, it's a lot to be wherever.

82
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,120
嗯 的确
Yeah. That's true.

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,820
教书真让人
School was like...

84
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,200
-呃 让人作呕 -呃
-Ugh, Grad school was... -Ugh.

85
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,820
没错
Exactly.

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,720
你结完婚还会想我吗？
Do you miss me even though you're married?

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,190
会啊 即便结了婚 还是会想你啊
Yes, I miss you even though I'm married.

88
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,180
婚姻啊
Married.

89
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,740
-哎 -都变成大人了
-Ugh. -So grown up.

90
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,970
真变成大人了
It's so grown up.

91
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,190
嘿 嘿 那边的
Hey! Hey, you over there!

92
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,280
我已经结婚了
I'm married!

93
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,360
刚领过证了
I'm in a union that the state knows about!

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,610
我爸离婚了
My dad is divorced.

95
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,860
哦 真惨
Oh, that's sad.

96
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,490
没关系的
That's okay.

I need to talk to you about something.

143
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,140
好
Okay.

144
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,850
嗯 好 是关于我身体的事
Okay. So it's about my body.

145
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,520
哦 你身材很棒
Oh, your body is perfect.

146
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
哦 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

147
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,150
但 呃 我不是那个意思
But, um, I didn't mean it like that.

148
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,400
嗯
Okay...

149
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,280
我肚子里有个孩子
So I have a baby in me.

150
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,160
-怀了？ -是啊
-You do? -Yeah.

151
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,030
什么？现在就怀了吗？
What? Right now?

152
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,540
现在
Right now.

153
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,870
-嗯 -真假的
-Yeah. -What?!

154
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,870
天呐
Oh, my God.

155
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,880
天呐 你的身体真是个奇迹
Oh, my God. Your body is a miracle.

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,380
天呐
Oh, my God.

157
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,880
你紧张吗？
Are you scared?

158
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,630
嗯 有点
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,800
但也很开心吧？
Oh, but are you glad?

160
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,300
嗯 是呀 挺好的
Yeah, yes. It's good.

161
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,490
显然这是我想要的
Like, I wanted it, obviously.

162
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,180
费了好大劲
Like, we tried a million times.

163
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,390
对 你确实想要
Yeah. You did want it.

164
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,230
-对 -利迪
-Yeah. -Lydie...

165
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,640
打算用我的名字吗？
Are you gonna name it Agnes?

166
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,400
哦
Oh.

167
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,610
嗯 我不知道 我不确定
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know.

168
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,190
别急着拒绝
Try and think about it.

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,910
捐的精子质量肯定不错
So it must have been good sperm.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,510
对啊 幸好如此
Yeah. Thank God for that

171
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,340
某个高个儿白人的好精子
random, tall white guy's good sperm.

172
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,770
要不我也用他生个孩子
Maybe I should have his babies too

173
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,430
正好当兄弟
and then they can be brothers.

174
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,640
挺难查到他的
Well, he's pretty hard to track down, so.

175
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,940
有照片嘛 能把他查出来
Well, we have his picture, so we could look him up.

176
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,740
能摸摸吗？
Can I touch it?

177
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,080
好啊
Yeah.

178
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,250
什么都感觉不到
I don't really feel anything.

179
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,420
因为还没长成个小宝宝
That's because it's not like a baby yet.

180
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,500
多大了？
How old is it?

181
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,590
有十周吧
Ten weeks?

182
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,240
所以估计挺小的
So probably really small.

183
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,540
对
Yeah.

184
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,600
像小老鼠那么大？
What, like a mouse maybe?

185
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,850
老鼠有多大来着？
How big is a mouse?

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,640
哦 比那还小
Oh, it's smaller than that.

187
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,310
哇 竟然比老鼠小
Wow, smaller than a mouse.

188
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,700
今晚可别跟任何人提这个
Don't tell anyone tonight about...

189
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,900
放心吧
Oh, don't worry.

190
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,180
我从不乱说秘密
I never tell secrets

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,320
除非我真想讲
unless I feel it is a secret I really wanna tell.

192
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,680
这话听着一点也不让人放心 宝贝
That is not reassuring, babe.

193
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,120
我真不想去
I don't wanna go.

194
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,450
不行
No!

195
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,120
不行 得去 不然娜塔莎会把我宰了
No, we have to. Natasha will kill me.

196
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,460
我觉得 她给人感觉态度不好
I feel like... I feel like she's, like, rude,

197
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,570
说话带刺
like, tonally.

198
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,735
可不是 她讲话可刺人了
Oh, she definitely has a very rude tone.

199
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
对吧
Right?

200
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,410
她说话态度真有问题
She's got a really rude tone.

201
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,550
你怕吗？
Are you afraid?

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,550
有点
Yeah.

203
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,910
是怕疼吗？
For the pain?

204
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,350
是啊
Yeah.

205
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,230
但这是个独立的人啊
But also because it's like, a person.

206
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,280
我想养出个好人
I wanna make a really good person.

207
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,840
你会把孩子带成好人的
You're gonna make a good person.

208
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,220
会疼得要命的
It's gonna hurt so bad.

209
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,620
可不是 会疼死你的
Oh, my God, it seems like it hurts so bad!

210
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,080
不 别这么说
No! Don't say that.

211
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,180
我能说
I'm allowed to say that,

212
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,490
不许你说
you're not allowed to say that.

213
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,370
废话不说
Blah, blah, blah. Doesn't matter.

214
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,420
简而言之 房子买到了
Short story is, we got the house,

215
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,170
但花的比我们预期多得多
but we had to pay, like, significantly more than we wanted to.

216
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,820
这房子是我的 你喜欢吗？
Do you like this house? My house?

217
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,720
嗯 挺喜欢的
I, I do. Yeah. Oh, my God.

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,660
木头 好有质感
The wood... it's gorgeous.

219
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,620
这可是高档的 低调奢华
It's rich. Like dark.

220
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,810
-嗯 -准备搬哪些东西来？
-Yeah. -What are you gonna put in it?

221
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,280
-这房子？ -对
-In our house? -Yeah.

222
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,100
嗯 沙发
Uh... our couch,

223
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,350
床
our bed,

224
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,900
本尼父母留给她的五斗柜
Benny's parents' dresser.

225
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,570
-基本上什么都搬来 -对 没错
-All your stuff. -Yes. Exactly.

226
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,570
难怪
That makes sense.

227
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,240
你现在真的长大了
You're like a fully fledged adult now.

228
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,370
大伙儿 我们有多久没聚了？
Guys, how long has it been since, like, we've hung out?

229
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,050
见面只能尴尬来句...
I'm just sort of like...

230
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,950
你好
Hi.

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
我们毕业有三年了吧？
Is it three years since we graduated?

232
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,750
-四年了吧 -哦 都四年了吗
-Four, I think. -Oh, my God, is it four years?

233
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,660
是啊
Yeah.

234
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
时光飞逝啊
Time really does fly.

235
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,710
时光真飞逝啊
Time really does fly.

236
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,670
不过 对我和安尼丝大概不算
But not for me or Agnes probably,

237
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,840
我们还呆在学校里
since we're still here, still at the school.

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,240
你还呆在那房子里
You're still at your same house.

239
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,855
小小的旧房子
That little house.

240
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,450
就你们三个走出去的觉得飞逝
But time probably flies for the three of you who left.

241
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,810
-去纽约啦 -嗯 对 纽约
-New York. -Yeah, yeah. New York.

242
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,930
哦
Wow.

243
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,615
替你高兴
Good for you.

244
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,228
嗯 回来这趟感触挺深
Um, but it's a trip being back.

245
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:50,325
去安尼丝家路上路过学校
I drove past the campus on my way to Agnes',

246
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,770
见到图书馆就起鸡皮疙瘩
and I just got, like, full body chills when I saw the library.

247
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:55,320
那图书馆 利迪 别提了
The library. Lydie, no. please.

248
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:56,715
你懂吧
You know what I mean?

249
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,005
那地方给我留着很深的压力印记
I have, like, deeply ingrained stress from that place.

250
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,183
对 读研时真太狠了
Yeah, Grad school was wild. I honestly feel like

251
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,060
我那论文感觉写了得有十年
I worked on that thesis for like, a decade.

252
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:07,515
可不是嘛 有次我在图书馆自习室
Yeah. This one time, um...on the third floor in a private room,

253
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,240
差点想用《小杜丽》那书
I almost paper cut my face open with my copy of Little Dorrit

254
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,265
{\an7}英国作家狄更斯刻画阶级与贫困的辛辣作品

255
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:13,522
把脸划破 好去医院里睡个安稳觉
just so I could go to the hospital and have a good night's sleep.

256
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,113
没真做 但闪过这念头
I didn't do it, but I thought about it.

257
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,945
嗯 有时候我做噩梦
Yeah, sometimes I have nightmares

258
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,735
梦到我论文全变白纸 我还把它吞了
where my thesis is like all blank pages, and then I eat the pages.

259
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,430
天呐 那好可悲
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

260
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,770
是啊 可不是嘛 真的挺可悲的
Yeah. It is really sad, huh.

261
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:30,615
那么 安尼丝 你就过得很好了吗？
So, Agnes, it was really that easy for you?

262
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,888
不想谈谈什么经历吗？
No story? Nothing to share?

263
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,995
那事儿可不是安尼丝的错 是德克尔太粘她
Well, it's not Agnes' fault that Decker liked her best.

264
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,125
对 不是她的错 说来我都生气
No, it wasn't her fault,  but, um, it pissed me off.

265
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,833
这鱼做的不错 里面放了什么
This fish is amazing. What's... what's in it?

266
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,410
鱼啊
Fish.

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,540
你们俩近况如何？
Uh... well, how is it, you two?

268
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,210
都是老师了
You're the teachers now.

269
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:54,605
我还没有转正
I am still part time,

270
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,130
不过下学期会让我带一门课吧
but I think I'm gonna teach a class next semester...

271
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,130
学校还没正式说 但挺有戏
which they haven't said is what's gonna happen, but it could.

272
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:01,806
-是啊 挺有戏 -是一定会
-Yeah, it could. -No. It will.

273
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,260
对 对 一定会
Yeah. Yes. It, it will.

274
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,010
我们英语系这边有新情况
Well, we have news in the English department.

275
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:08,195
安尼丝 该你说大新闻了
Agnes? Agnes has big news.

276
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,995
去下洗手间 抱歉
Bathroom. Sorry.

277
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,050
安尼丝已转正 占了威尔金森留的位置
Agnes is now a full-time teacher. She took Wilkinson's spot.

278
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:15,915
是接手了 那位置
Filled the spot.

279
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,169
安尼丝真厉害 这么年轻就转正了
Agnes is like super young to be full-time faculty.

280
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,971
对 五十年来最年轻的 靠腿上位的
Yeah, she's like the youngest in fifty years, that bitch.

281

开玩笑啦
I'm kidding.

282
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,287
没去干净
There's a bone.

283
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,120
什么？
What?

284
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,664
鱼刺没去干净
In the fish.

285
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,782
{\an9}西餐通常会把鱼刺和骨头去除后上桌

286
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,880
你这鱼没剔干净 里面还有根鱼刺
There's, like, a bone in the fish that you served me.

287
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,130

00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,347
没事 没事
No, it's... it's fine.

289
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,275
下次你招待客人
It's just like maybe you should, like,

290
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,082
把鱼刺处理好 要注意点礼数
debone it a little bit better before you serve it to people.

291
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,900

301
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,840
你仍然在同一个办公室

304
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,100
好吧 我……我不想解释
Well, I... I didn't wanna have to explain

305
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,350
为什么我待在那间办公室里感觉很奇怪
why it's weird for me to be in that office.

306
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,190
也许你应该说有霉菌或别的什么东西
Maybe you should say there's mold or something.

307
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,230
或许
Maybe.

308
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,440
你想让我打电话给他们说
Do you want me to call them and say

309
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,070
墙里有一只死动物？
there's a dead animal in the wall?

310
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,820
你是来自天堂的天使 但不是
You are an angel from heaven, but no.

311
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,320
就像我刚刚得到这份工作一样
It's like, I just got the job.

312
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,530
我甚至不知道我是否应该得到这份工作
I don't even know if I should have the job.

313
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,660
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

314
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,960
我不想抱怨我的办公室
I don't wanna complain about my office,

315
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,670
从技术上来说 这是巨大的
which is technically huge,

316
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,710
光线充足
and there's a lot of light,

317
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,090
我明白他为什么喜欢它

318
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,760
不管怎样 是的 我离开了家
Anyways, yes, I leave the house.

319
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,850

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,570
如果我要自杀
If I was gonna kill myself,

324
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,110
我会像去年一样这样做……
I would have done it like last year...

325
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,280
或前年
or the year before.

326
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,740
呃 或者 肯定是前一年
Ugh. Or, like, definitely the year before.

327
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,910
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

328
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,040
不 我不会死

329
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,540
让我回报这份感情
Let me return the sentiment.

330
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,710
你千万别死啊
You please don't die.

331
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,050

你要生一个小宝宝了
You're having a little baby.

你会好好照顾你的小宝宝的
You're gonna take such good care of your little baby.

335
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,110

我不是你的妈妈
I'm not your mommy.

346
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,490
我是你妈妈
I am your mommy.

347
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,660
噢 看在上帝的份上
Oh, for goodness sake.

348
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,030
我感觉到它踢了我一下
I felt it kick.

349
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,620

我有一张加床

告诉弗兰我讨厌他们

不是因为 比如
Not because of, like,

364
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,620
并不是因为我要自杀 而只是……

365
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,990

好的
Okay.

369
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,650
{\an8}经历坏事的那年

370
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,190
他妈的！

—发生什么事了？—天啊！

我的大脑感觉像着火了一样
My brain feels like it's on fire.

377
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,950
就像我快要死了一样！
Like I'm gonna fucking die!

378
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,370
我刚刚意识到 宝贝
I just realized, babe,

379
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,290
没人关心泰德·休斯
no one gives a fuck about Ted Hughes.

不 每个人都关心泰德休斯

381
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,500
不不不 我简直不敢相信
No, no, no. I can't believe this.

382
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,840
我花了两年时间写一个人
I spent two years writing about a guy.

383
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,670
我甚至不再睁着眼睛和男人做爱了
I don't even fuck guys with my eyes open anymore.

384
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,510
我只是闭上眼睛想象着女人
I just close my eyes and imagine women.

385
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,680
你想谈论这个吗？
Do you wanna talk about that?

386
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,270
关于什么？
About what?

387
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,100
没有什么
Nothing.

388
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,910
好的 我来了 抱歉 我来了
Okay, I'm here. Sorry, I'm here.

389
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,120
我们做到了吗？
Did we do it?

390
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,540
仅仅
Barely.

391
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,670
—德文？—是的 我做到了
-Devin? -Yes, I did.

真的很抱歉 我其实不拖延
I am so sorry. I don't really procrastinate,

393
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,090
所以这对我来说不算什么
so this wasn't like a whole thing for me.

394
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,760
没关系
That's okay.

395
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,510
继续炫耀吧 它会让你获得成功
Keep showing off, it'll get you places.

396
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,810
莉迪亚
Lydie.

397

别生气 我已经看完了
like, don't be mad. I did finish it.

402
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,820
最后一页就像是复制粘贴的摘录......
The last page is, like, a copy and paste extract of...

403
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,990
《向伯利恒跋涉》不是我写的
"Slouching Towards Bethlehem" that I didn't write.

404
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,210

永远是迪迪恩
Always Didion.

406
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,090
呃...嘿 你知道吗？
Uh... Hey, you know what?

407
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,090
我应该是你的导师、助手 或者其他什么的
I'm supposed to be your mentor, helper, whatever.

408
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,800
我来这里只是为了确保这件事能够发生

Lydie, you think you can finish by Wednesday?

412
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,270

你会读我的书吗？

416
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,280
当然 这是我的工作
Of course. That's my job.

417
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,240
你要问艾格尼丝她是否做了这件事吗？
Are you gonna ask Agnes if she did hers?

418
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,280
是的
Yeah.

419
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,950

Can't wait to read.

423
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,180
但你也会读我的 对吧？
But you're gonna read mine too though, right?

424
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
是的
Yes.

425
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,520
我为什么还在做这件事？
Why am I still working on this?

426
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,150
因为你还没完成它
Because you didn't finish it.

427
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,270
无意冒犯
No offense.

428
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,280
别吹牛了
Stop bragging.

429
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,400
我不是在吹牛
I'm not bragging.

430
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,490
你的腿靠在墙上
Your legs are on the wall.

431
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,820
所以？
So?

432
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,200
好吧 如果我完成了它
Well, if I'd finished it,

433
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
我的腿也会靠在墙上
my legs would be on the wall too,

434
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,200
但我没有
but I haven't.

435
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,040
所以 我的腿不在墙上
So, my legs aren't on the wall.

436
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,620
好的 我会把它们拿下来
Okay. I will take them down.

437
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,350
什么？
What?

438
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,310
你应该操他
You should fuck him.

439
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,190
我不想和他做爱
I don't wanna fuck him.

440
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,690
—真的吗？—是的
-Really? -Yes.

441
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,860
好吧 如果你不想和他上床
Well, if you don't wanna fuck him,

442
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,070
绝对不要和他发生性关系
definitely don't fuck him.

443
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,200
我不会
I won't.

444
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,120
我觉得他想和你做爱
I think he wants to fuck you.

445
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,120
—真的吗？—是的
-Really? -Yeah.

446
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,250
—嗯 真糟糕 —为什么？
-Well, that sucks. -Why?

447
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,710
你认为这就是他说我聪明的原因吗？
Do you think that's why he's telling me I'm smart?

448
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,250
不 我觉得他在告诉你你很聪明
No, I think he's telling you you're smart

449
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,710
因为你真的很聪明
because you're really smart.

450
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,720
好的
Okay.

451
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,600
但你会说什么呢……
What would you say though...

452
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,180
如果他要求你和他做爱？
if he asked you to fuck him?

453
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,930
我会说不
I would say no.

454
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,690
如果他问起的话我会很不高兴
I would be upset if he asked.

455
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,560
我明白
I get that.

456
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,320
我明白
I get that.

457
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,490
我会说不...
I would say no...

458
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,700
但谢谢你
but thank you.

459
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,500
进来吧
Come on in.

460
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,000
你好
Hi.

461
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,000
艾格尼丝 你好
Agnes, hi.

462
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,340
感谢您与我会面
Thanks for meeting with me.

463
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,840
你在忙些什么吗？
Are you working on something?

464
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,970
我是说...
I mean...

465
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,760
不 不 不……
No. Not, not...

466
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,850
并不真地
not really.

467
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,600
好吧 现在你必须告诉我
Well, now you have to tell me.

468
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,940
为什么？
Why?

469
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
因为现在我知道的太多了
Because now I know too much.

470
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,990
嗯 好的 嗯……
Uh, yeah, okay. Um...

471
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,780
我正在写一本书
I'm writing a book.

472
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,450
—一本书？—一本书
-A book? -A book.

473
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,580
一本很长的书？
A long book?

474
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,450
-中等 -良好
-Medium. -Good.

475
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,000
为什么？
Why?

476
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,420
嗯 长就像...好的 我们明白了
Well, long is like... okay, we get it.

477
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,590
对 短的就像……
Right. And short is like...

478
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,290
你为什么要写这本书？
Why did you even write a book?

479
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,300
是啊 虽然这是中等的……
Yeah, well, even though this is medium...

480
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,840
—长度刚刚好 —是的
-The perfect length. -Yeah.

481
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,640
我不得不说这太可怕了
I have to say it is horrible,

482
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,060
每次看到它 我就想自杀
and every time I look at it, I wanna kill myself.

483
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,180
毫米
Mm.

484
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,600
嗯 确实有这样的书
Well, there actually have to be books like that

485
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,690
这样我们就可以区分
so that we can distinguish

486
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,480
哪些书才是真正的好书
which books are really the good books.

487
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,440
是的
Yes.

488
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,110
我写这本烂书是为了做公益
I'm doing a public service by writing a shit book.

489
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,530
出色地
Well,

490
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
如果有帮助的话
if it helps at all,

491
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,000
我喜欢你的第一部小说
I liked your first novel.

492
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,830
我喜欢它有多糟糕并且......
I liked how fucked up it was and...

493
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,040
这让我觉得这是有原因的
how it made me feel like there's a reason,

494
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,130
即使我看不到 我也知道我还活着
even if I can't see it, that I'm alive.

495
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,000
这并不像小说
And it didn't feel like fiction,

496
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,380
我认为在这种情况下这是一种赞美
which I think is a compliment in this case.

497
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,670
和...
And...

498
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,640
我在做其他事情的时候也一直在想这件事
I think about it all the time when I'm doing other stuff,

499
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,600
就像吃冰淇淋一样
like eating ice cream

500
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,060
或者看着窗外
or looking out the window.

501
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,060
谢谢
Thank you.

502
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,690
谢谢
Thank you.

503
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,280
好的 呃...
Okay, uh...

504
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,780
一...
Um...

505
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,870
关于我的事就说到这里吧
Enough about me.

506
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,290
我读了你的论文
I read your thesis.

507
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,830
你读得真快
You read it really fast.

508
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,080
是啊 嗯 我 呃...
Yeah, well, I, uh...

509
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,460
说实话 我实在无法放下它
to be honest, I couldn't put it down.

510
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,590
有人把你的手粘在上面吗？
Someone glue your hands to it?

511
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,090
什么？
What?

512
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,800
—哦...—对不起
-Oh... -I'm sorry.

513
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,340
基本上没有任何意义
Makes basically no sense.

514
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,180
不 确实如此
No, it does.

515
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,510
一...
Um...

516
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,550
是的
Yeah.

517
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,810
— 无论如何 所以 呃... — 是啊
-Anyway, so, uh... -Yeah.

518
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,600
整个部分
This whole section

519
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,850
从第三页到第七页
from page three through seven,

520
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,190
我发现这绝对公正……
I find to be absolutely just...

521
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,650
非凡的
extraordinary.

522
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,900

Really.

523
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,950

You should have my full attention,

532
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,560
坦白说 这篇论文值得得到这样的评价

533
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,930
—我们可以稍后再安排 —好的 没问题

好的
All right.

546

我们被要求考虑这个想法
We are asked to reckon with the idea

547
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,710
夺走他的生命
that taking his life,

548
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,460
逃离物质存在
taking flight from the corporeal existence,

549
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,880
也许是给 Milkman 的
is perhaps for Milkman

550
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,600
这是一场超越 而非悲剧
a transcendence and not a tragedy.

551
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,680
米尔克曼感觉自己正在回到祖籍地

567
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,930
你的鞋带松了
Your shoes are untied.

568
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,550
哦
Ooh.

569
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,300
嘿 我真是一直在屏息等待
Hey, I've been literally waiting with bated breath.

570
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,470
进展如何？
How did it go?

571
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,020
艾格尼丝 你还好吗？
Agnes, are you okay?

572
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,940
发生了什么？
What happened?

573
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,610
我不知道
I don't know.

574
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,070
我的裤子破了
My pants are broken.

575
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,960
然后我们开始接吻
And then we started kissing.

576
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,050
我以为我们在接吻
And I thought, we're kissing.

577
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,220
我以为我们一直在接吻
I was thinking we were kissing the whole time,

578
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,430
就像以一种不好的方式
like in a bad way

579
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,100
当你过得不开心的时候
where you aren't having a good time,

580
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,060
就像某人的嘴一样
and it's just like someone's mouth.

581
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,350
然后我说
And then I said,

582
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,400
“我真的不认为我准备好接吻了
"I don't really think I'm ready to be kissing.

583
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,060
我刚刚摆脱了一件事 ”
I just got out of a thing."

584
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,860
这是我编造的
Which is something I made up.

585
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,440
对此撒谎是可以的
It's okay to lie about that.

586
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,570
然后他说 “没关系 ”
And then he said, "That's okay."

587
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,490
“我们可以坐在沙发上看电影 ”
"We can just sit on the couch and watch a movie."

588
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,120
于是他开始玩一些东西
So he started playing something.

589
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,210
它是动画的 我认为这很奇怪
It was animated, which I thought was weird.

590
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,420
但后来我想起他有个孩子
But then I remembered he has a kid,

591
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,840
这样就没那么奇怪了
so that made it less weird.

592
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,300
然后他开始把手放在我的裤子上
Then he started putting his hand on my pants,

593
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,390
我正把它移开
and I was kinda moving it away.

594
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,560
但他一直把它移回我的裤子里
But he kept moving it back to my pants,

595
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,980
然后他开始把手伸进我的裤子里 就像
and then he started putting his hand down my pants, like,

596
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,110
在裤子和内衣之间
in between the pants and my underwear.

597
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,610
我的身体扭动得像……
And I was kinda squirming my body like...

598
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,450
他是……
he was...

599
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,120
他的手指非常有力且坚硬
his fingers were really strong and hard,

600
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,450
就像 以不好的方式
like, in the bad way.

601
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,660
就像 这太难了
Like, it was too hard.

602
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,590
也许感觉会很好
Maybe it would've felt good

603
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,090
如果我希望他的手指能做到这一点
if I wanted his fingers to be doing that.

604
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,300
但你并不想要那样
But you didn't want that.

605
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,510
不 我没有
No, I didn't.

606
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,970
然后 我把他的手拉了出来 因为……
And then, I pulled his hand out because...

607
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,060
感觉不太好
it didn't feel good,

608
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,560
而且确实有点疼
and it actually hurt, kinda.

609
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,610
然后我开始亲吻他
And then I started kissing him

610
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,900
因为我认为
because I thought,

611
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,780
“好吧 如果我们必须做点什么的话 ”
"Well, if we have to be doing something,"

612
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,740
“我宁愿亲吻 也不愿他的手指伸进去 ”
"I'd rather it be kissing than his fingers down there."

613
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,120
然后我就不记得了
And then I don't remember.

614
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
然后在某个时刻
And then at some point,

615
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,760
他的手又伸进了我的内裤
his hand was back in my underwear.

616
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,090
但现在在内衣下面
But under the underwear now.

617
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,390
我又试图把它移开
And I was trying to move it away again.

618
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,600
听起来你曾多次试图将它移开
Sounds like you were trying to move it away a lot.

619
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,270
是的 我一直这么想
Yeah. That's what I kept thinking.

620
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,730
就像 再来一次 他就不会再把它移回去
Like, one more time and he won't move it back

621
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,690
因为它太明显了 所以我把它移开了
because it's so obvious I'm moving it away.

622
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,860
但他一直将其移回
But he kept moving it back.

623
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,820
进而...
And then...

624
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,040
他正在拉下我的裤子……
he was pulling down my pants...

625
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,750
嗯 他试图把它们拉下来
Well, he was trying to pull them down,

626
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,120
但它们有一个按钮
but they have a button.

627
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,290
所以他一直拉啊拉
So he was pulling, pulling.

628
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,750
我把它们拉了回来
And I was pulling them back up.

629
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,760
然后他们就走到了半山腰
And then they were halfway down.

630
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,930
我感觉有什么东西进入了我的体内
And I felt something go in, like, in me,

631
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,520
我的脊椎开始发凉
and my spine got cold.

632
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,230
我伸手去摸它 然后……
And I reached down to feel it and...

633
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,150
这是……
It was...

634
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,030
就是他……你知道吗？
It was him... you know?

635
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,330
然后我跳了起来......
And then I jumped up and...

636
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,740
我坐在沙发边上
I sat on the side of the couch.

637
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,750
我不知道要多久
I don't know how long.

638
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,340
我看了一眼他的脸
And I looked at his face once,

639
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,550
它看起来好像很害怕
and it was, like, scared.

640
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,590
—他的脸上露出了害怕的表情？—是的
-His face was scared? -Yes.

641
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,640
然后我就慢慢地站了起来
And then I just got up kinda slowly,

642
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,310
我抓起靴子
and I grabbed my boots,

643
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,190
然后我开车回家
and I drove home,

644
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,990
现在我在这里
and now I'm here.

645
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,330
听起来像...
That sounds like...

646
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,000
那
that.

647
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,090
那是...
That is...

648
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,680
就是这样
that's the thing.

649
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,310
我真的非常非常抱歉
I'm really, really sorry.

650
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,930
我不知道我是否应该完全赤裸
I never know if I'm supposed to get fully naked.

651
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,600
—就像穿着长袍一样？—是的
-Like in the gown? -Yeah.

652
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,770
—你现在裸体吗？—是的
-Are you naked right now? -Yes.

653
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
兄弟 我认为你不应该裸体
Dude, I don't think you're supposed to be naked.

654
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,690
你好 你是艾格尼丝吗？
Hi. You're Agnes?

655
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,780
—是的 你好 —我是埃文斯医生
-Yeah, hi. -I'm doctor Evans.

656
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,330
你被性侵了吗？
You were sexually assaulted?

657
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,450
嗯 是的
Uh, yeah.

658
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,700
你现在觉得安全吗？
Do you feel safe now?

659
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,580
抱歉 在我们这样做之前
Sorry, before... uh, we do that,

660
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,430
我只是想让你知道我全身赤裸
I just want you to know that I'm fully naked.

661
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,130
-什么？-在长袍下面 可以吗？
-What? -Under the robe. Is that okay?

662
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,340
嗯 没问题
Yeah. That's fine.

663
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,430
—你介意吗？—当然可以
-Do you mind? -Yeah, sure.

664
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,180
那么 这是什么时候发生的？
So, when did this happen?

665
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,390
那件事？
The thing?

666
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,940
—袭击 —昨晚
-The assault. -Last night.

667
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,140
昨天晚上
Last evening.

668
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,650
昨天晚上
Yesterday evening.

669
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,230
—你洗澡了吗？—我洗了个澡
-And have you showered? -I took a bath.

670
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,980
所以最好去急诊室
So it's usually best to go to the emergency room

671
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,820
就在这样的事情发生之后
right after something like this happens.

672
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,610
哦好的
Oh, okay.

673
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,410
下次我一定会记住这一点
I will definitely keep that in mind for the next time.

674
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,490
嗯 这时候我们会用
Well, that's when we would use

675
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,080
性侵犯法医证据工具包
a sexual assault forensic evidence kit.

676
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,950
哦 好的 我觉得你只需要……
Oh, okay. I feel like you just need to...

677
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,290
音调上偏离了音调
tonally shift away from the tone

678
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,210
你现在正在服用
you're taking right now.

679
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,960
就像 我们只是需要音调的转变
Like, we just need a tonal shift.

680
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,080
只是想确认他没有给我任何东西
Just wanna make sure he didn't give me anything,

681
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,880
比如 阴道或者
like, vaginally or yeah.

682
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,470
袭击者在你体内射精了吗？
Did your attacker ejaculate in you?

683
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,260
嗯 我不会称他为袭击我的人
Um, well, I wouldn't call him my attacker.

684
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,180
这不像是 呸！
It wasn't like, bah!

685
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,350
但你被强奸了
But you were raped.

686
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,470
—哇哦 —是的
-Whoa. -Yeah.

687
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,640
说得好
And well put.

688
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,520
我知道这很难说
I know this is hard to talk about.

689
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,310
感觉你不知道这一点
It doesn't feel that you know that.

690
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,690
这些问题是礼仪问题
These questions are protocol.

691
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,030
是的 你问他们的方式真的很怪异
Yeah, you're asking them in a really freaky way.

692
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,360
冷静一下 女士
Calm down, ma'am.

693
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,780
—哦 她很冷静 —我很冷静
-Oh, she's calm. -I'm calm.

694
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,200
你可以继续提问了
You can finish your questions.

695
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,490
他射精到你体内了吗？
Did he ejaculate in you?

696
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,160
可怕的词
Horrible word.

697
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,330
不 他实际上在我体内
No, the actual him being inside me part

698
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,040
没过多久 就像……
wasn't that long, it was like...

699
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,000
—那么久 —好的
-that long. -Okay.

700
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,050
所以 我们会进行血液检查 检查你是否怀孕
So, we'll do a blood test to check you for pregnancy

701
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,130
以及性传播感染
and sexually transmitted infections,

702
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,970
然后我们会进行宫颈培养
and then we'll do a cervix culture.

703
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,970
-嗯 -什么事？
-Yum. -Excuse me?

704
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,010
她说好吃
She said yum.

705
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,930
我马上回来 我们就可以开始了
I'll be right back, and we can get started.

706
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,320
—艾格尼丝？—嗯
-Agnes? -Mhmm.

707
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,450
他要走了

00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,580
德克尔正在转学

他要走了

712
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,960

716
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,680
也许吧 我不知道

717
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,520
他对此有何评论？

719
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,190
昨天他的办公桌非常乱

720
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
就像他没有打包任何东西一样

721
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,580
所以他正在跑步

722
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,000
他妈的
Fuck.

00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,110
—嗨 我是...—艾格尼丝

728
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,460
得知您遭遇此事 我们深感抱歉

729
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,960
我们正在采取这一行动

730
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,380

731
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,600
你会做什么吗？
Are you gonna do anything?

732
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,560
我们将开始调查

733
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,930
但正如你可能听说的那样
But as you may have heard,

734
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,690
他昨天在……递交了辞职信

下午 4:18

737
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,320
好的
Okay.

738
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,780
不幸的是 他不再受雇于我们了
Unfortunately, he's no longer under our employ.

739
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,790
因此我们不能采取通常采取的措施
So we can't take the measures that we would normally take

740
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,830
比如暂停他或者解雇他或者……
such as suspending him or letting him go or...

741
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,210
类似这样的事情

这些事情真的很难
These things are really hard,

743
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,470
不幸的是 大学无法
and the University is unfortunately unable

744
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,720
承担任何责任
to take any kind of responsibility.

745
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,550
但他是我的顾问

746
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,270
前任顾问

747
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,310
您可以选择

748
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,860

749
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,110
并发出逮捕令

750
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,240

比如他的头发或者他的笔或者别的什么

I told the neighbor, it's like this whole big lie.

833
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,390
我陷入了谎言之中
I'm stuck in a lie.

834
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,720
好的 我会做的
Okay. I will do it.

835
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,520
—对不起 —不 没关系
-I'm sorry. -No, it's fine.

836
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,770
我本来要去杀一个人 所以这容易多了
I was gonna, like, kill a man, so this is much easier.

837
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,520

843
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,130
这真是太好了
This is really nice.

844
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,430

Tuna.

850
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,910
也许你只是闻到了罐头的味道

851
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,240
里面有金枪鱼

00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,450
你在撒谎
You're lying.

861
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,410
不 我不是

对于那些还没有这样做的人
For those of you who haven't done this

869
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,300
不知道会发生什么
and don't know what to expect,

870
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,430
请上来

你可以走了
You can go.

886
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,840
富勒夫人 您觉得呢？
And do you think, Mrs. Fuller,

887
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,250
根据该定义
based on that definition,

888
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,880
你明白“排除合理怀疑”的意思吗？
you understand the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt?

889
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,550
是的
Yes.

890
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,340
毫无疑问地确信
That to be convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt,

891
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,390
你一定去过那里
you must have been there

892
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,050
并亲眼目睹了犯罪行为？
and seen the crime with your own eyes?

893
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,760
是的 我明白
Yes. I understand.

894
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,140
你们其他人是否觉得
And do the rest of you feel

895
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,980
你可以应用这个想法 毫无疑问
you can apply that idea, beyond a reasonable doubt,

896
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,350
—对于这个案子？—嗯
-to this case? -Mhmm.

897
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,000
你们当中有多少人有孩子？
How many of you have children?

898
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,190
呃 沃加德先生
Uh, Mr. Woguard.

899
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,320
你有孩子吗？
You have a child?

900
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,150
嗯 是的 索菲刚满四岁
Uh, yes. Soph just turned four.

901
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,070
假设你和你的女儿在公园
Say you and your daughter were at the park

902
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,450
她正在玩攀爬架
and she's playing on the monkey bars.

903
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,370
你转过身去几分钟
And you turned your back for a few minutes,

904
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,700
然后她就带着断掉的手臂跑向你
and then she runs over to you with a broken arm.

905
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,870
您认为会发生什么？
What would you think happened?

906
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,210
她从攀爬架上摔了下来
She fell off the monkey bars

907
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,170
并打断了她的手臂
and broke her arm.

908
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,630
是的 这是一个例子
Yes, so that's an example

909
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,540
间接证据
of circumstantial evidence.

910
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,130
这就是你可以合理推断的
That's what you can reasonably infer

911
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,260
根据你所掌握的事实
based on the facts that you have.

912
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,920
这有道理吗 沃加德先生？
Does this make sense, Mr. Woguard?

913
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,550
是的
Yes.

914
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,180
如果另一个孩子跑向你
And if instead another child ran over to you

915
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,770
并告诉你他看到她从攀爬架上摔下来
and told you he saw her fall off the monkey bars,

916
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,350
这是直接的证词
that's direct testimony

917
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,640
因为有人目睹了这一切
because someone witnessed it.

918
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,060
大家明白这个区别吗？
Does everybody understand that difference,

919
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,110
间接证据之间
between circumstantial evidence

920
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,610
和直接证词？
and direct testimony?

921
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,030
嗯
Mhmm.

922
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,490
在没有直接证词的情况下
Without direct testimony,

923
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,530
我们不能肯定
we cannot be positively certain

924
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,320
犯罪已经发生
a crime has been committed.

925
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,830
正如检方所说
As the prosecution,

926
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,700
我必须证明被告有罪
I must prove the defendant's guilt

927
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,450
毫无合理怀疑
beyond a reasonable doubt.

928
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,830
意思是 没有其他合理的解释
Meaning, that there is no other reasonable explanation

929
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,040
这可以从所提供的证据中得出
that can come from evidence presented.

930
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,500
如果你们当中有人成为犯罪的受害者
If any of you have been victims of a crime,

931
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,050
请举手
please raise your hand.

932
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,180
呃 费伯先生 犯罪内容是什么？
Uh, Mr. Faber, what was the crime?

933
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,350
呃 我被抢劫了 被枪指着
Uh, I was robbed. At gunpoint.

934
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:03,680
你有什么理由相信
Do you have any reason to believe

935
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,430
这段经历会让你无法服务
that experience would make you unable to serve

936
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:07,810
作为本次审判的公正陪审员？
as an impartial juror on this trial?

937
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,060
不
No.

938
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,150
沃德小姐
Miss Ward.

939
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
什么？
What?

940
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,480
当我问谁是犯罪的受害者时
When I asked who has been a victim of a crime,

941
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,490
你举手了吗？
did you raise your hand?

942
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:20,070
不 我意识到我不应该分享它
No, I realized I shouldn't share it.

943
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,610
所以...
So...

944
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,700
你不能分担罪行吗？
You're unable to share the crime?

945
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,200
一...
Um...

946
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,000
坦白说这是我最可怕的噩梦
It is frankly my worst nightmare

947
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,540
必须告诉整个房间的陌生人
to have to tell this whole room of strangers

948
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,080
关于发生在我身上的事
about the thing that happened to me.

949
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:33,880
所以...
So...

950
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,460
这就是我没有决定的原因
that is the reasoning as to why I did not decide

951
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,630
继续举手
to continue having my hand raised.

952
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
谢谢
Thank you.

953
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:45,470
你认为该罪行会导致你无法服役
Do you think the crime would make you unable to serve

954
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,970
作为此案的公正陪审员？
as an impartial juror on this case?

955
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,430
这是个好问题
That is a good question,

956
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,390
这也是我一直在思考的问题
and one I've been thinking about.

957
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,520
你得出什么结论了吗？
Have you come to any conclusions?

958
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,110
你知道 我想我会更好
You know, I think I would be better

959
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,570
不在陪审团中
not being on the jury

960
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,610
反而会做得更好
and instead would do better

961
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,700
履行不同的公民角色
fulfilling a different civic role.

962
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,990
您心目中的公民角色是什么样的？
And what kind of civic role do you have in mind?

963
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,490
所以 谢谢你的提问
So, thank you for asking.

964
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,660
我其实是一名教授
I am actually a professor,

965
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,710
兼职 希望很快能成为全职
part-time, hopefully soon full-time,

966
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,670
其中 教学是重要的工作
which, teaching is important work.

967
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,960
我认为教学很重要
I think teaching is important.

968
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,670
有人会说老师是理想的陪审员
Some would say that a teacher makes an ideal juror.

969
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,470
绝对不是 不是
Absolutely not, no.

970
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,180
在您的问卷上 您写道……
On your questionnaire, you wrote...

971
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,470
哦 不 不
Oh, no, no.

972
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:30,220
我不知道我们会大声朗读这些 所以
I did not know that we would be reading those aloud, so.

973
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,140
“你的朋友会如何形容你？”
"How would your friends describe you?"

974
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:33,100
“聪明的 ”
"Smart."

975
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,060
划掉“tall”这个词
Crossed out, then the word "tall."

976
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,110
如果你所遭受的犯罪行为使你产生偏见
If the crime you were a victim of makes you biased,

977
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,280
我们将解雇你
we will dismiss you.

978
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,570
我告诉你这件事会惹上麻烦吗？
Can I get in trouble for telling you?

979
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,990
如果你是受害者 为什么你会遇到麻烦？
Why would you get in trouble if you were the victim?

980
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,240
我不知道
I don't know.

981
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,750
我认为这项法律毫无意义
The law makes no sense in my opinion.

982
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,420
我...
I...

983
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,970
事实上我之前没有大声说过
I haven't said it out loud actually before.

984
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,180
嗯 没关系
Well, that's okay.

985
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,140
你去报警了吗？
Did you go to the police?

986
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,520
不
No.

987
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,890
我只有一个按钮
All I had was a button,

988
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,690
我不想让他进监狱
and I don't want him to go to jail.

989
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,400
这是为什么？
Why is that?

990
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:21,900
他有一个孩子
He has a kid.

991
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,990
我希望他不要再做这样的事
I want him to stop being someone who does that.

992
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,250
如果他进了监狱
And if he went to jail,

993
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,580
他只是做了这样的事 现在却被关在监狱里
he'd just be someone who does that, who's now in jail.

994
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,550
法官大人 我可以上法官席吗？

1106
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,970
夹在形式之间
caught between the form,

1107
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,510
演示本身
the presentation itself,

1108
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,640
以及演讲的内容？
and the content of that presentation?

1109
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,640
呃 教授……那位女士回来了

01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,820
-你喜欢弗兰吗？-哦 是的 弗兰人很好
-Do you like Fran? -Oh, yeah. Fran is nice.

有点内敛 个子很高
Reserved, kind of. Really tall.

1124
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:13,960
发生什么事了？
What's happening?

1125
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,120
所以你得到了这份工作
So you got the job.

好的 嗯...
Okay, well, um...

1132
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,480
只是因为事情对你来说很容易
just because things come easy to you

1133
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,060
并不意味着你可以从别人那里拿走东西

1134
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,440

who things don't come easy to.

1135
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,650
对我来说事情并不容易
Things don't come easy to me.

1136
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,900
是的 大家都喜欢你
Yes they do. Everyone likes you.

1137
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,690
—你很聪明 你很性感 —谢谢你
-You're smart, you're hot. -Thank you.

1138
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,940
呃 不是那样的
Ew, not like that.

1139
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,700
洛根喜欢你 德文也喜欢你
Logan likes you, Devin likes you.

1140
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,900
Lydie 喜欢你
Lydie likes you.

1141
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:47,530
德克尔喜欢你
Decker likes you.

1142
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,620
嗯 你不喜欢我
Well, you don't like me.

1143
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,000
这是真的
That's true.

1144
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,590
这是真的
That's true.

1145
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,310
你知道 当我想到这一点时
You know, when I think about it,

1146
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,890
我认为德克尔实际上恨我
I think Decker actually hated me.

1147
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:18,650
你是他选中的人
You were his chosen one.

1148
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,150
这真是太疯狂了
That's a completely insane thing to say.

1149
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,110
不
No.

1150
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,070
因为当你喜欢某人或者
Because when you like someone or, like,

1151
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,860
当你尊重某人时
when you respect someone,

1152
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,200
人们对待你的方式有些不同
there are some ways people treat you

1153
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,160
这是一种方法
that are one way.

1154
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,120
尊重 并且喜欢
Respectful, and like,

1155
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,580
你是一个活着、呼吸着的人
you're a person who lives and breathes

1156
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,290
并独立思考
and thinks for them self.

1157
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,960
但有些人对待你的方式却不是那样的
And then some ways people treat you are not that way,

1158
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,210
而且它们很糟糕
and they're bad.

1159
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,350
好吧 嗯 我和他上床了……
All right. Well, um, I fucked him...

1160
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,060
他甚至没有花时间
and, uh, he didn't even take the time

1161
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,850
亲自给我论文做笔记 所以……
to give me in-person notes on my thesis. So...

1162
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,980
你跟他上床了？
You fucked him?

1163
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,650
是的
Yeah.

1164
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,990
你想要那个吗？
Did you want that?

1165
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,280
想要啥？
Want what?

1166
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,700
是故意的吗？
Was it on purpose?

1167
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,120
是的 这是故意的
Yes, it was on purpose.

1168
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,460
我们进行了大约五分钟的性爱
We had, like, five minute sex.

1169
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,290
还行吧 我吃过更好的了
It was just okay. I've had better.

1170
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,740
我们关门了 这里不能停车
We're closed. You can't park here.

1171
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,000
哦 糟糕 哦 糟糕
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1172
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,380
听着 我很抱歉对你大喊大叫
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1173
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,050
我的孩子汉克也会出现呼吸困难的情况
My kid, Hank, gets these breathing attacks too,

1174
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,300
有时真的很糟糕
real bad sometimes.

1175
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:12,130
我知道你很害怕
I know you're scared,

1176
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,430
但你已经离开了道路 坐在车里
but you're off the road, you're in your car,

1177
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,430
你没事
and you're okay.

1178
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,270
我要呼吸 你也和我一起呼吸
I'm gonna breathe and you breathe with me.

1179
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,730
好吗？你跟着就行
Okay? You just follow.

1180
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,310
好吗？准备好了吗？在……
All right? You ready? In...

1181
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:27,860
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1182
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,280
在...
In...

1183
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,610
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1184
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:35,740
在...
In...

1185
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:41,200
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1186
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:43,500
在...二、三
In... two, three.

1187
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,420
出去...
Out...

1188
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,630
二、三、四、五
Two, three, four, five.

1189
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,590
我必须说实话
I gotta be honest,

1190
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,760
我不太会这样呼吸
I don't really breathe like that,

1191
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,970
但感觉很好
but it feels good.

1192
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,090
你还好吗？
You doing okay?

1193
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:57,970
对你有好处
Good for you.

1194
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,930
你想要一个三明治吗？
You want a sandwich?

1195
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,740
我想在这里摆放桌子
I wanted to put tables out here

1196
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,860
所以 你知道 人们不会坐在地上
so, people, you know, wouldn't sit on the ground.

1197
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,410
这是一个美味的三明治
It's a good sandwich.

1198
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,700
你不应该吃一个好三明治
You shouldn't eat a good sandwich

1199
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,870
当你坐在地上时
while you're sitting on the ground

1200
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,040
鸽子拉屎的地方
where the pigeons shit.

1201
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:23,660
任何
Whatever.

1202
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,790
但他们说 你们共享一个……
But they said, you share a...

1203
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,630
垃圾场里有停车场
a parking lot with the guys at the dump.

1204
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,540
所以你得问问垃圾场的人
So you gotta ask the guys at the dump.

1205
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:32,550
我才不会问垃圾场里的人呢！
No fucking way I'm asking the guys at the dump!

1206
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,880
他妈的混蛋
Fucking assholes.

1207
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,140
这很好
This is good.

1208
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,640
是的 当然好
Yeah, of course it's good.

1209
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,270
你没有三明治店
You don't have a sandwich shop,

1210
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,690
你做的三明治不太好
you don't make a good sandwich.

1211
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,400
辛辣的
Spicy.

1212
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,730
卡拉布里亚辣椒 非常昂贵
Calabrian chili, very expensive.

1213
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,320
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

1214
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,280
咦？
Huh?

1215
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,950
—艾格尼丝？—是的
-Agnes? -Yeah.

1216
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,580
-呃 -哇哦
-Ugh. -Whoa,

1217
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,540
你们听起来就像垃圾堆里来的坏人
you sound like the mean guys from the dump.

1218
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,250
嘿！我……我对此感到不满
Hey! I res... I resent that.

1219
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:10,130
那些家伙都是混蛋 说实话 我不是混蛋
Those guys are assholes. I'm honest, not an asshole.

1220
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,010
你有个儿子？
You have a son?

1221
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,880
他是个混蛋
He's an asshole.

1222
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:18,260
汉克
Hank.

1223
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,890
—汉克是……—呃……
-Hank is... -Ugh...

1224
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,810
你不必告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

1225
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,850
听起来太像“honk”这个词了
Sounds too much like the word honk.

1226
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,060
—你有孩子吗？—没有
-You have kids? -No.

1227
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,570
想要一些吗？
Want some?

1228
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,990
呃……好吧 我真的无法想象自己变老
Uh... Well, I can't really imagine myself old.

1229
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,320
你以为我想象中的自己是这样的吗？
You think I imagined myself like this?

1230
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,580
不 不管你信不信
No, believe it or not,

1231
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,910
我没有想到我会
I did not think I would end up

1232
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,120
看上去就像一个有嘴的山药
looking like a yam with a mouth on it.

1233
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,500
但我们就在这儿
But here we are.

1234
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,920
这也会发生在你身上
It'll happen to you.

1235
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,130
你不会知道是什么击中了你
You won't know what hit you.

1236
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,600
我遇到了一件非常糟糕的事情
Something pretty bad happened to me,

1237
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,810
这可能就是我行为怪异的原因
so that's probably why I'm acting weird.

1238
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,020
有多糟糕？
How bad?

1239
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,190
一...
Um...

1240
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,810
我想真的很糟糕
I guess really bad.

1241
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,940
你不知道这很糟糕吗？
You don't know it's bad?

1242
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,490
不 我知道这很糟糕
No, I know it's bad.

1243
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,240
但主要是因为每当我告诉别人这件事时
But mainly because whenever I tell anyone about it,

1244
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,500
他们看起来真的为我感到害怕
they look really scared for me.

1245
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,250
除了我的朋友 但她搬走了
Except for my friend, but she moved away.

1246
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,420
有时候我一想到这件事就觉得难过
And then sometimes I feel bad when I think about it,

1247
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,460
因为...
because...

1248
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:39,340
我记得那些时刻
I remember moments of it,

1249
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:44,800
我可以感觉到我的身体
and I can feel in my body

1250
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,600
那真的很糟糕
that it was really bad.

1251
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,770
但有时我不会去想它
But then sometimes I don't think about it,

1252
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:52,940
这很奇怪
which is weird.

1253
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,570
当我不去想这件事时 我就会感到内疚
And I feel guilty when I don't think about it.

1254
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:01,820
刚刚发生的事吗？
Did it just happen?

1255
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,500
这就是你气喘吁吁的原因吗？
Is that why you were huffing and puffing?

1256
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,990
不 是三...
No, it was three...

1257
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,750
三年前
a little over three years ago.

1258
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,460
嗯 时间并不多
Well, that's not that much time.

1259
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,460
我的意思是 这需要很多时间
I mean, it's a lot of time,

1260
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,590
但时间也不多了
but it's not that much time, too.

1261
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,340
是的
Yeah.

1262
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,640
你是...
Are you...

1263
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,060
你家还好吗？
okay in your house?

1264
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:31,020
我有一只猫
I have a cat.

1265
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,440
好的
Okay.

1266
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,750
奥尔加 这到底是怎么回事？
Olga, what the fuck?

1267
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,670
奥尔加 去睡觉吧
Olga, go to bed.

1268
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,420
呃 奥尔加 你在我的床上拉屎了吗？
Ugh, Olga, did you shit in my bed?

1269
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,090
哦！奥尔加 这到底是怎么回事？
Oh! Olga, what the fuck?

1270
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,510
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1271
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,560
哦 如果你想杀死它
Oh, if you wanted to kill it,

1272
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,220
你应该直接杀了它！
you should have just killed it!

1273
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,770
好的 我回来了 我回来了
Okay. I'm coming back. I'm coming back.

1274
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,270
很快就结束了 好的 好的
It'll be over soon. Okay. Okay.

1275

Okay. What do I need? What am I looking for?

1276
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,860
哦！一个包 一个包！我有一个包！
Oh! A bag, a bag! I got a bag!

1280
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,500
不 不 你不会死的 你正在死去

Get in the bag.

1282
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,050
放进袋子里就可以了
Just go in the bag.

1283
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:44,880
对不起
I'm sorry.

1284
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,860
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1285
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,650
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

1286
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,250
加文！
Gavin!

Gavin!

1289
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,220
艾格尼丝 你还好吗？
Agnes, are you okay?

1290
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,560
艾格尼丝？什么……
Agnes? What...

1291
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,180
你还好嗎？
Are you okay?

1292
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,980
你会来操我嗎？
Will you come fuck me?

1293
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,690
是的
Yes.

1294
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:44,400
等一下 等一下 我需要鞋子
Wait, wait. I need shoes.

1295
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,860
我嗯……我确实需要鞋子
I um... I do need shoes.

1296
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,280
一秒钟
One second.

1297
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,950
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

1298
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,030
我可以小便吗？
Can I pee?

1299
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,370
哦 是的 当然
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

1300
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,810
我可以进去吗？
Can I get in?

1301
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,900
哦 在洗澡吗？
Oh, in the bath?

1302
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,060
是的
Yeah.

1303
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,650
呃 当然
Uh, sure.

1304
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:59,160
我只是要在这里转一圈
I'm just gonna turn around here.

1305
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,370
别介意我
Don't mind me.

1306
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,290
你不必隐藏它
You don't have to hide it.

1307
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,920
现在还很小
It's small right now.

1308
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,420
男人真是奇怪
Men are so weird.

1309
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,210
谢谢
Thank you.

1310
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,510
噢 那太好了
Oh, that's nice.

1311
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,270
温度适宜
It's a good temperature.

1312
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,480
谢谢
Thank you.

1313
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,480
我对自己隐藏自己的阴茎感到很尴尬
I'm embarrassed that I was hiding my dick.

1314
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,360
没关系
That's okay.

1315
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,240
我把头发放在胸部上
I put my hair over my boobs.

1316
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:37,700
如此真实
So true.

1317
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,000
抱歉 浴缸太小了
I'm sorry the bathtub is so small.

1318
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,750
这个浴缸？
This bathtub?

1319
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,630
不 很好
No, it's good.

1320
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,840
如果我坐在你后面呢？
What if I sat behind you?

1321
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,470
—为什么？—那么 呃……
-Why? -So, uh...

1322
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:02,060
它可能就像一个拥抱
it could be like a hug.

1323
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,770
好的
Okay.

1324
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,350
-是啊是啊
-Yeah? -Yeah.

1325
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:13,530
哦 等等 我可以看看吗？
Oh, wait. Can I look at it?

1326
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:15,780
嗎？
At my dick?

1327
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:17,740
是的
Yeah.

1328
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,460
唔...
Hmm...

1329
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,790
我从未见过如此柔软的
I've never seen one that soft.

1330
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
好吧 我觉得那只是让我做了恶梦
Okay, I think that just gave me nightmares

1331
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,130
未来十年
for the next decade.

1332
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:37,010
不 我的意思是 你永远不可能看到他们那样
No, I mean, you just never get to see them like that.

1333
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,180
他们这样会更好
They're better like this.

1334
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:45,520
唔...
Hmm...

1335
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,060
好的 我说完了
Okay, I'm done.

1336
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,240
毫米
Mm.

1337
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,460
毫米
Mm.

1338
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:17,090
你以为你想要每个人都有的东西吗？
Do you think you want the stuff that everyone has?

1339
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,470
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

1340
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,050
就像 呃
Like, uh,

1341
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,890
家庭或者其他什么的 我不知道
family or whatever. I don't know.

1342
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,980
你想要那些东西吗？
Do you want that stuff?

1343
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:29,980
与你？
With you?

1344
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,060
不
No.

1345
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,770
不 我的意思是 这是你的问题
No, I mean, it was your question.

1346
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,440
是的 我想要那个东西
Yeah. I want that stuff.

1347
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,070
好的
Nice.

1348
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,450
你？
Do you?

1349
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,990
出色地...
Well...

1350
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,330
你知道 可能只是为了让 Lydie 更亲近一些……
You know, probably just to keep Lydie closer...

1351
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,540
但我没有看到
but I don't see it.

1352
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:55,960
在哪里看到？
See it where?

1353
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,300
就像在我的脑海里一样
Like, in my head.

1354
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:02,340
我不认为自己会变老或者有孩子
I don't see myself getting older or having kids.

1355
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,260
我看不到我自己
I don't see myself.

1356
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,390
我认为你会是一位伟大的妈妈
I think you'd be a great mom.

1357
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,770
为什么？
Why?

1358
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,150
您非常友善
You're very nice.

1359
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,240
我没那么好
I'm not that nice.

1360
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,200
人们总是说他们不想要孩子
People always say they don't want a kid,

1361
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:29,910
但后来情况发生了变化
but then things change.

1362
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,330
我们想要什么等等...
What we want and stuff...

1363
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,580
我认为它会改变
I think it changes.

1364
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:45,720
太冷了
It's too cold.

1365
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,100
我认为这很好
I think it's nice.

1366
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:30,100
嗨！耶！

1375
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,320

1382

And now I know what an exploding vagina

1383

1386
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:05,760

1387
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,050

Fran, we're free! We're free.

1445
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,280
灯塔非常浪漫
The lighthouse is very romantic.

1446
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:38,540
你们两个应该单独在一起

有一个问题 如果她杀了我怎么办？

1451

我该对她说什么呢？
What do I say to her?

1464
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,460
宝贝 你什么也不用说
Babe, you don't have to say anything.

1465
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,510
二十分钟
Twenty minutes.

1466
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,040
你好

我是艾格尼丝
I'm Agnes.

1468
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,300
很奇怪有一天你会成为一个人
Pretty weird you're gonna be a person someday.

1469
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:18,390
无意冒犯 但你现在看上去很疯狂
No offense, but you look insane right now.

1470
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:20,800
皮肤和少量毛发
Skin and just a small amount of hair.

1471
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,970
不用担心
Don't worry.

1472
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:26,690
不久之后就不会这样了
It won't be like that in a little.

1473
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:34,650
这样可以吗或者...
Is this okay or...

1474
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:50,540
好的
All right.

1475
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,250
我就把你放下来
I'll put you down.

1476
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,840
哦 我去接你
Oh. I'll pick you back up.

1477
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,840
好的 好的 好的
Okay, okay, okay.

1478
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:23,410
你看上去真甜美
You're so sweet looking.

1479
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:42,300
等你长大了 什么都可以告诉我
When you grow up, you can tell me whatever.

1480
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,100
比如 如果你有一个想法
Like, if you have a thought

1481
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:48,600
你会觉得这个想法很糟糕
and you're like, that's a bad thought,

1482
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:52,560
我可能也有同样的想法 但是
I probably had that same thought but, like,

1483
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:54,820
糟糕十倍
ten times worse.

1484
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,280
所以你直接告诉我就可以了
So you can just tell me.

1485
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:01,530
我永远不会被这个吓到
I'll never be scared by that.

1486
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,290
如果有人对你做了坏事……
If someone does something bad to you...

1487
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,960
如果有人说了一些可怕的事情......
If someone says something scary...

1488
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:17,880
如果你想自杀
If you wanna kill yourself

1489
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,380
用铅笔或者小刀或者其他什么东西
with like a pencil or a knife or whatever,

1490
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:24,640
你可以直接告诉我
you can just tell me.

1491
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,640
我永远不会告诉你你让我害怕
I'll never tell you you're scaring me.

1492
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:34,520
我只能说 是的
I'll just say, yeah.

1493
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:36,400
我知道
I know.

1494
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:39,230
有时候就是这样
It's just like that sometimes.

1495
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:41,700
是的
Yeah.

1496
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:46,620
对不起
I'm sorry

1497
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,830
不好的事情将会发生在你身上
that bad things are gonna happen to you.

1498
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,830
我希望他们不会
I hope they don't.

1499
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,590
如果我能阻止某件事变坏
If I can ever stop something from being bad,

1500
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:57,750
让我知道
let me know.

1501
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:03,380
但有时糟糕的事情就会发生
But sometimes bad stuff just happens.

1502
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,060
这就是为什么我为你感到难过
That's why I feel bad for you,

1503
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,140
在某种程度上
in a way.

1504
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:16,350
你还活着 但你还不知道这一点
That you're alive and you don't know that yet.

1505
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,070
但我仍然可以听
But I can still listen

1506
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,410
不要害怕
and not be scared.

1507
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,750
这很好
So that's good.

1508
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,210
或者至少是这样的
Or that's something, at least.

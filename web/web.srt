25
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,736
—我就是这么想的 —是的
-This is what I think. -Yeah.

26
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,237
当你和一个男人发生性关系时...
When you are having sex with a guy...

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,321
是的
Yeah.

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,074

-Sometimes... -Mhmm.

29
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,952
他们说的是
They are saying stuff like,

30
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,705
“你喜欢这个 ”
"You like that."

31
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,915
嗯
Mhmm.

32
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,750
你喜欢那个
You like that.

33
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,710
嗯 那到底是什么？
Mhmm. What is that, even?

34
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,836
正确的
Right.

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,755
噢 这很深奥
Oh, that's deep.

36
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,590
我认为...我认为他们的意思是
I think... I think they mean

37

40
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,765
但就像 他们喜欢 就像
But it's like, they like, it's like,

41
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,600
他们的阴茎也是他们的全部
also their dick is their whole self.

42
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,935
所以他们会问 “你喜欢这根鸡巴吗？
So they're like, "Do you like the dick?

43
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:04,936
你喜欢我吗？”
Do you like me?"

44
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,187
-“你爱我吗？” -“你爱我吗！”
-"Do you love me?" -"Do you love me!"

45
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,107
“而我正在操你......
"And I am fucking you...

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,235
-用我的鸡巴 ”-对
-with my dick." -Right.

47
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,736
有时就像...
And sometimes it's like...

48
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,946

49

有时就像...
Sometimes it's like...

52
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,287
有点
Kinda.

53
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,413
—不 是的 —就像……
-No. It is. -It's like...

54
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,791
有时就像你忘记了自己
Sometimes it's like you leave your mind

55
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,376
你从……的角度看它
and you're like, seeing it from, like,

56
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,086
—背后的视角 —在他们的大脑里
-perspective behind. -Inside their brain.

57
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,797
你的屁股看起来很奇怪
Your butt looks weird.

58
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,715
有时就像...对！
Sometimes it's like... right!

59
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,292
那么 你会让我读它吗？
So, are you gonna let me read it?

60
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,668
是的 但还没完
Yeah. But it's not done.

61
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,169
这甚至不是一个正式的草案

62

但这只是一份草稿

65
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,425
是的 但现在
Yeah, but now it's, like,

66
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,135
黑暗、像心理的 但也很有趣
dark and like psychological, but also funny.

I will need to read that.

00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,674
—艾格尼丝 —嗯
-Agnes. -Mhmm.

143
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,718
我需要和你谈一些事
I need to talk to you about something.

144
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,137
好的
Okay.

145
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,850
好的 所以这是关于我的身体
Okay. So it's about my body.

146
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,518
哦 你的身材很完美
Oh, your body is perfect.

147
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,602
噢 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

148
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,147
但是 呃 我不是那个意思
But, um, I didn't mean it like that.

149
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,397
好的...
Okay...

150
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:48,278
所以我体内有一个孩子
So I have a baby in me.

151
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,158
— 你知道吗？— 是的
-You do? -Yeah.

152
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,034
啥？现在就去？
What? Right now?

153
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,536
现在
Right now.

154
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,870
—是的 —什么？！
-Yeah. -What?!

155
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,874
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

156
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,877
哦天哪 你的身体真是个奇迹
Oh, my God. Your body is a miracle.

157
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,378
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

158
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,880
你害怕吗？
Are you scared?

159
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,631
是啊是啊
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,799
噢 但是你高兴吗？
Oh, but are you glad?

161
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,303
是的 是的 很好
Yeah, yes. It's good.

162
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,429
就像 我显然想要它
Like, I wanted it, obviously.

163
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,181
就像 我们尝试了一百万次
Like, we tried a million times.

164
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,390
是的 你确实想要它
Yeah. You did want it.

165
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,225
—是的 —莉迪……
-Yeah. -Lydie...

166
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,644
你要给它取名叫艾格尼丝吗？
Are you gonna name it Agnes?

167
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,397
哦
Oh.

168
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,607
是啊 我不知道 我不知道
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know.

169
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,193
尝试去想一想
Try and think about it.

170
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,446
哇
Wow.

171
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,921
所以它一定是好精子
So it must have been good sperm.

172
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,505
是的 感谢上帝
Yeah. Thank God for that

173
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,342
随机的 高个白人的好精子
random, tall white guy's good sperm.

174
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,765
也许我也应该为他生孩子
Maybe I should have his babies too

175
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,434
然后他们就可以成为兄弟了
and then they can be brothers.

176
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,644
嗯 他很难被追踪到 所以
Well, he's pretty hard to track down, so.

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,730
嗯 我们有他的照片
Well, we have his picture,

178
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,939
这样我们就可以查找他
so we could look him up.

179
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,741
我可以摸一下嗎？
Can I touch it?

180
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,076
是的
Yeah.

181
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,251
我真的没什么感觉
I don't really feel anything.

182
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,419
那是因为它还不像婴儿
That's because it's not like a baby yet.

183
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,504
它有多大了？
How old is it?

184
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,590
十周？
Ten weeks?

185
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,008
所以可能真的很小
So probably really small.

186
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,094
是的
Yeah.

187
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,595
什么？像老鼠一样？
What, like a mouse maybe?

188
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,638
老鼠有多大？
How big is a mouse?

189
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,644
哦 比那还小
Oh, it's smaller than that.

190
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,312
哇 比老鼠还小
Wow, smaller than a mouse.

191
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,695
今晚不要告诉任何人...
Don't tell anyone tonight about...

192
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,904
噢 别担心
Oh, don't worry.

193
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,114
我从不泄露秘密
I never tell secrets

194
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,324
除非我觉得这是一个我真正想说的秘密
unless I feel it is a secret I really wanna tell.

195
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,618
宝贝 这让人很不安
That is not reassuring, babe.

196
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,120
我不想去
I don't wanna go.

197
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,454
不！
No!

198
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,124
不 我们必须这么做 娜塔莎会杀了我的
No, we have to. Natasha will kill me.

199
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,460
我觉得……我觉得她很粗鲁
I feel like... I feel like she's, like, rude,

200
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,503
就像 音调上
like, tonally.

201
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,672
哦 她的语气确实很粗鲁
Oh, she definitely has a very rude tone.

202
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,715
正确的？
Right?

203
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,132
她的语气真的很粗鲁
She's got a really rude tone.

204
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,553
你害怕嗎？
Are you afraid?

205
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,349
—是的 —因为疼痛？
-Yeah. -For the pain?

206
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,351
是的
Yeah.

207
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,229
但也因为它就像一个人
But also because it's like, a person.

208
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,065
我想成为一个真正优秀的人
I wanna make a really good person.

209
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,651
你会成为一个好人的
You're gonna make a good person.

210
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,155
这会很痛
It's gonna hurt so bad.

211
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,615
天啊 好像很疼啊！
Oh, my God, it seems like it hurts so bad!

212
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,075
不！别这么说
No! Don't say that.

213
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,118
我可以这么说
I'm allowed to say that,

214
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,494
你不能这么说
you're not allowed to say that.

215
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,372
啦啦啦 没关系
Blah, blah, blah. Doesn't matter.

216
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,416
简而言之 我们得到了房子
Short story is, we got the house,

217
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,542
但我们必须付钱
but we had to pay, like,

218
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,168
远远超出了我们的预期
significantly more than we wanted to.

219
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,088
你喜欢这房子吗？我的房子？
Do you like this house? My house?

220
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,717
是的 我知道 是的 哦 我的天哪
I, I do. Yeah. Oh, my God.

221
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,969
木头……很漂亮
The wood... it's gorgeous.

222
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,554
味道浓郁 就像黑色的
It's rich. Like dark.

223
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,806
—是的 —你要在里面放什么？
-Yeah. -What are you gonna put in it?

224
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,266
—在我们家？—是的
-In our house? -Yeah.

225
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,101
呃...我们的沙发
Uh... our couch,

226
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,353
我们的床
our bed,

227
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,896
本尼父母的梳妆台
Benny's parents' dresser.

228
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,565
—所有你的东西 —是的 没错
-All your stuff. -Yes. Exactly.

229
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,566
这很有道理
That makes sense.

230
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,235
你现在就像一个成熟的成年人了
You're like a fully fledged adult now.

231
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,364
伙计们 我们有多久没一起出去玩了？
Guys, how long has it been since, like, we've hung out?

232
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,948
我只是有点像...
I'm just sort of like...

233
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,241
你好
Hi.

234
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,118
我们毕业已经三年了？
Is it three years since we graduated?

235
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,745
—我想是四年 —哦 天哪 是四年吗？
-Four, I think. -Oh, my God, is it four years?

236
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:25,662
是的
Yeah.

237
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,247
时间过得真快
Time really does fly.

238
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,707
时间过得真快
Time really does fly.

239
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,667
但对我和艾格尼丝来说可能不是
But not for me or Agnes probably,

240
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,837
因为我们还在这里 还在学校
since we're still here, still at the school.

241
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,172
你仍旧在你原来的房子里
You're still at your same house.

242
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,799
那栋小房子
That little house.

243
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,002
但对于离开的你们三个人来说 时间可能过得很快
But time probably flies for the three of you who left.

244
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,805
—纽约 —是啊 是啊 纽约
-New York. -Yeah, yeah. New York.

245
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:43,930
哇
Wow.

246
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,557
对你有好处
Good for you.

247
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,767
嗯 但回来也是一次旅行
Um, but it's a trip being back.

248
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,270
我开车去艾格尼丝学校的路上经过了校园
I drove past the campus on my way to Agnes',

249
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,689
我感觉浑身发冷
and I just got, like, full body chills

250
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,774
当我看到图书馆的时候
when I saw the library.

251
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,192
图书馆 Lydie 不
The library. Lydie, no.

252
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,652
—拜托 —你明白我的意思吗？
-Please. -You know what I mean?

253
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,946
我在那里承受着根深蒂固的压力
I have, like, deeply ingrained stress from that place.

254
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,282
是的 研究生院很疯狂 说实话 我觉得
Yeah, Grad school was wild. I honestly feel like

255
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,951
我研究这篇论文已有十年了
I worked on that thesis for like, a decade.

256
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,120
是啊 就这一次 嗯……
Yeah. This one time, um...

257
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,454
在三楼的一间私人房间里
on the third floor in a private room,

258
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,248
我差点被我的复印件划破脸
I almost paper cut my face open with my copy

259
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,999
去医院
of Little Dorrit just so I could go to the hospital

260
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,876
并睡个好觉
and have a good night's sleep.

261
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,670
我没做过 但是我想过
I didn't do it, but I thought about it.

262
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,883
是的 有时我会做噩梦
Yeah, sometimes I have nightmares

263
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,218
我的论文是这样的
where my thesis is like

264
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,679
全是空白页 然后我把这些页吃掉
all blank pages, and then I eat the pages.

265
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,431
噢 天哪 这太可悲了
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

266
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,766
是啊 真的很难过 呵呵
Yeah. It is really sad, huh.

267
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,561
那么 艾格尼丝 这对你来说真的那么容易吗？
So, Agnes, it was really that easy for you?

268
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,479
没有故事？没什么可分享的？
No story? Nothing to share?

269
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,941
好吧 德克尔最喜欢艾格尼丝 这不是她的错
Well, it's not Agnes' fault that Decker liked her best.

270
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,151
不 这不是她的错
No, it wasn't her fault,

271
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,401
但是 嗯 这让我很生气
but, um, it pissed me off.

272
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,407
一...
Um...

273
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,701
这条鱼太神奇了 它里面……有什么？
This fish is amazing. What's... what's in it?

274
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,411
鱼
Fish.

275
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,540
呃……嗯 你们俩怎么样？
Uh... well, how is it, you two?

276
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,208
你们现在是老师了
You're the teachers now.

277
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,543
我目前还是兼职
I am still part time,

278
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,129
但我想我下学期会教一门课……
but I think I'm gonna teach a class next semester...

279
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,547
他们没说
which they haven't said

280
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,132
是即将发生的事情 但它有可能发生
is what's gonna happen, but it could.

281
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,800
—是的 有可能 —不 它会的

There's, like, a bone in the fish that you served me.

296
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,133

在端给人们吃之前 先把它去骨一点

305
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,952

00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,721
艾格尼丝 你说过你要换
Agnes, you said that you were gonna switch.

312
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,098
好吧 我……我不想解释
Well, I... I didn't wanna have to explain

313
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,350
为什么我待在那间办公室里感觉很奇怪
why it's weird for me to be in that office.

314
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,188
也许你应该说有霉菌或别的什么东西
Maybe you should say there's mold or something.

315
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,231
或许
Maybe.

316
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,440
你想让我打电话给他们说
Do you want me to call them and say

317
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,067
墙里有一只死动物？

318
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,820
你是来自天堂的天使 但不是

319
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,323
就像我刚刚得到这份工作一样
It's like, I just got the job.

320
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,534
我甚至不知道我是否应该得到这份工作
I don't even know if I should have the job.

321
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,660
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

322
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,957
我不想抱怨我的办公室
I don't wanna complain about my office,

323
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,667
从技术上来说 这是巨大的
which is technically huge,

324
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,710
光线充足
and there's a lot of light,

325
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,089
我明白他为什么喜欢它

我不会死
I'm not gonna die.

331
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,569
如果我要自杀
If I was gonna kill myself,

332
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,114
我会像去年一样这样做……
I would have done it like last year...

333
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,283
或前年
or the year before.

334
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,744
呃 或者 肯定是前一年
Ugh. Or, like, definitely the year before.

335
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,911
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

336
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,038
不 我不会死

338
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,712
你千万别死啊
You please don't die.

339
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,052

你要生一个小宝宝了
You're having a little baby.

我不是你的妈妈
I'm not your mommy.

354
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,488
我是你妈妈
I am your mommy.

355
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,656
噢 看在上帝的份上
Oh, for goodness sake.

356
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,032
我感觉到它踢了我一下
I felt it kick.

357
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,617

我有一张加床

告诉弗兰我讨厌他们

385
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,371
我刚刚意识到 宝贝
I just realized, babe,

386
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,291
没人关心泰德·休斯

我花了两年时间写一个人

390
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,673
我甚至不再睁着眼睛和男人做爱了
I don't even fuck guys with my eyes open anymore.

391
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,508
我只是闭上眼睛想象着女人
I just close my eyes and imagine women.

392
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,680
你想谈论这个吗？
Do you wanna talk about that?

393
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,265
关于什么？
About what?

394
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,102
没有什么
Nothing.

395
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,913

我们做到了吗？
Did we do it?

397
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,542
仅仅
Barely.

398
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,672
—德文？—是的 我做到了

真的很抱歉 我其实不拖延
I am so sorry. I don't really procrastinate,

400
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,094
所以这对我来说不算什么
so this wasn't like a whole thing for me.

401
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,763
没关系
That's okay.

402
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,514
继续炫耀吧 它会让你获得成功
Keep showing off, it'll get you places.

403
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,808

别生气 我已经看完了
like, don't be mad. I did finish it.

409
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,822
最后一页就像是复制粘贴的摘录......
The last page is, like, a copy and paste extract of...

410
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,993
《向伯利恒跋涉》不是我写的
"Slouching Towards Bethlehem" that I didn't write.

411
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,206
—耶茨还是迪迪恩？—迪迪恩

413
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,086
呃...嘿 你知道吗？

414
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,089
我应该是你的导师、助手 或者其他什么的
I'm supposed to be your mentor, helper, whatever.

415
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,800
我来这里只是为了确保这件事能够发生

当然 这是我的工作
Of course. That's my job.

424
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,237
你要问艾格尼丝她是否做了这件事吗？
Are you gonna ask Agnes if she did hers?

425
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,282
是的
Yeah.

426
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:47,950
艾格尼丝……
Agnes...

427
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,079
你的情况怎么样？
How'd yours go?

428
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,082
好的 我做到了
Fine. I did it.

429
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,334
迫不及待想读
Can't wait to read.

430
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,177
但你也会读我的 对吧？
But you're gonna read mine too though, right?

431
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:00,963
是的
Yes.

432
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,520
我为什么还在做这件事？
Why am I still working on this?

433
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,147
因为你还没完成它
Because you didn't finish it.

434
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,272
无意冒犯
No offense.

435
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,275
别吹牛了
Stop bragging.

436
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,400
我不是在吹牛
I'm not bragging.

437
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,486
你的腿靠在墙上
Your legs are on the wall.

438
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:25,822
所以？
So?

439
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,198
好吧 如果我完成了它
Well, if I'd finished it,

440
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,200
我的腿也会靠在墙上
my legs would be on the wall too,

441
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,201
但我没有
but I haven't.

442
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,037
所以 我的腿不在墙上
So, my legs aren't on the wall.

443
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,623
好的 我会把它们拿下来
Okay. I will take them down.

444
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,351
什么？
What?

445
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,313
你应该操他
You should fuck him.

446
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,191
我不想和他做爱
I don't wanna fuck him.

447
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,692
—真的吗？—是的
-Really? -Yes.

448
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,860
好吧 如果你不想和他上床
Well, if you don't wanna fuck him,

449
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,070
绝对不要和他发生性关系
definitely don't fuck him.

450
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,195
我不会
I won't.

451
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,115
我觉得他想和你做爱
I think he wants to fuck you.

452
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,118
—真的吗？—是的
-Really? -Yeah.

453
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,247
—嗯 真糟糕 —为什么？
-Well, that sucks. -Why?

454
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,710
你认为这就是他说我聪明的原因吗？
Do you think that's why he's telling me I'm smart?

455
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,253
不 我觉得他在告诉你你很聪明
No, I think he's telling you you're smart

456
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,713
因为你真的很聪明
because you're really smart.

457
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,715
好的
Okay.

458
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,595
但你会说什么呢……
What would you say though...

459
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,181
如果他要求你和他做爱？
if he asked you to fuck him?

460
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:34,932
我会说不
I would say no.

461
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,685
如果他问起的话我会很不高兴
I would be upset if he asked.

462
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,563
我明白
I get that.

463
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,316
我明白
I get that.

464
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,485
我会说不...
I would say no...

465
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,696
但谢谢你
but thank you.

466
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,496
进来吧
Come on in.

467
00:24:58,748 --> 00:24:59,999
你好
Hi.

468
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,001
艾格尼丝 你好
Agnes, hi.

469
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,339
感谢您与我会面
Thanks for meeting with me.

470
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,841
你在忙些什么吗？
Are you working on something?

471
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:08,966
我是说...
I mean...

472
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,762
不 不 不……
No. Not, not...

473
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,848
并不真地
not really.

474
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,601
好吧 现在你必须告诉我
Well, now you have to tell me.

475
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:20,937
为什么？
Why?

476
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,022
因为现在我知道的太多了
Because now I know too much.

477
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,985
嗯 好的 嗯……
Uh, yeah, okay. Um...

478
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,781
我正在写一本书
I'm writing a book.

479
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,450
—一本书？—一本书
-A book? -A book.

480
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,576
一本很长的书？
A long book?

481
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,454
-中等 -良好
-Medium. -Good.

482
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:39,998
为什么？
Why?

483
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,417
嗯 长就像...好的 我们明白了
Well, long is like... okay, we get it.

484
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,585
对 短的就像……
Right. And short is like...

485
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,294
你为什么要写这本书？
Why did you even write a book?

486
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,301
是啊 虽然这是中等的……
Yeah, well, even though this is medium...

487
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,844
—长度刚刚好 —是的
-The perfect length. -Yeah.

488
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,637
我不得不说这太可怕了
I have to say it is horrible,

489
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,056
每次看到它 我就想自杀
and every time I look at it, I wanna kill myself.

490
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,182
毫米
Mm.

491
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,604
嗯 确实有这样的书
Well, there actually have to be books like that

492
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,688
这样我们就可以区分
so that we can distinguish

493
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,481
哪些书才是真正的好书
which books are really the good books.

494
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,442
是的
Yes.

495
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,111
我写这本烂书是为了做公益
I'm doing a public service by writing a shit book.

496
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,532
出色地
Well,

497
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,242
如果有帮助的话
if it helps at all,

498
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,995
我喜欢你的第一部小说
I liked your first novel.

499
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,830
我喜欢它有多糟糕并且......
I liked how fucked up it was and...

500
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,041
这让我觉得这是有原因的
how it made me feel like there's a reason,

501
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,126
即使我看不到 我也知道我还活着
even if I can't see it, that I'm alive.

502
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,004
这并不像小说
And it didn't feel like fiction,

503
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,381
我认为在这种情况下这是一种赞美
which I think is a compliment in this case.

504
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,674
和...
And...

505
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,636
我在做其他事情的时候也一直在想这件事
I think about it all the time when I'm doing other stuff,

506
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,596
就像吃冰淇淋一样
like eating ice cream

507
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,055
或者看着窗外
or looking out the window.

508
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,061
谢谢
Thank you.

509
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,689
谢谢
Thank you.

510
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,277
好的 呃...
Okay, uh...

511
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,779
一...
Um...

512
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:55,865
关于我的事就说到这里吧
Enough about me.

513
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,285
我读了你的论文
I read your thesis.

514
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,828
你读得真快
You read it really fast.

515
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,079
是啊 嗯 我 呃...
Yeah, well, I, uh...

516
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,458
说实话 我实在无法放下它
to be honest, I couldn't put it down.

517
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,585
有人把你的手粘在上面吗？
Someone glue your hands to it?

518
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,088
什么？
What?

519
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,798
—哦...—对不起
-Oh... -I'm sorry.

520
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,341
基本上没有任何意义
Makes basically no sense.

521
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,176
不 确实如此
No, it does.

522
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,512
一...
Um...

523
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,554
是的
Yeah.

524
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,806
— 无论如何 所以 呃... — 是啊
-Anyway, so, uh... -Yeah.

525
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,601
整个部分
This whole section

526
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,854
从第三页到第七页
from page three through seven,

527
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,190
我发现这绝对公正……
I find to be absolutely just...

528
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,650
非凡的
extraordinary.

529
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:34,904
真的
Really.

530
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:37,948
对不起
Sorry.

531

She's in court, my kid's sick. I have to...

536
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,009
我得跑了
I've gotta run.

537
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,554
—操 对不起 —哦 没关系

你应该引起我的全部注意
You should have my full attention,

539
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,557
坦白说 这篇论文值得得到这样的评价
and frankly, this paper deserves that.

540
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,934
—我们可以稍后再安排 —好的 没问题
-We can reschedule for later. -Yeah, that's fine.

-Okay. -I'll, uh...

543

544
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,191
—哦 没关系 —哦 实际上
-Oh, that's okay. -Oh, actually,

545
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,486
你应该看看这个
you should look at this.

546
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,489

好的
All right.

553
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,626
我们被要求考虑这个想法
We are asked to reckon with the idea

554
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,711
夺走他的生命
that taking his life,

555
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,464
逃离物质存在
taking flight from the corporeal existence,

556
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,883
也许是给 Milkman 的
is perhaps for Milkman

557
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,595
这是一场超越 而非悲剧
a transcendence and not a tragedy.

558
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,681
米尔克曼感觉自己正在回到祖籍地
Milkman feels he is returning to his ancestral home.

Oh, do you mind taking your boots off?

569
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,421
哦 是的
Oh, yeah.

570
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,798
—呃 —不
-Duh. -No.

571
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,633
—抱歉 —别抱歉
-Sorry. -Don't be sorry.

572
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,012
你有我的论文吗？
Do you have my thesis?

573
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,014
哦 是的 是的 是的 是的
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,925
你的鞋带松了
Your shoes are untied.

575
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,546
哦
Ooh.

576
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,299
嘿 我真是一直在屏息等待
Hey, I've been literally waiting with bated breath.

577
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,466
进展如何？
How did it go?

578
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,018
艾格尼丝 你还好吗？
Agnes, are you okay?

579
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:28,937
发生了什么？
What happened?

580
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,607
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,072
我的裤子破了
My pants are broken.

582
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,960
然后我们开始接吻
And then we started kissing.

583
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,047
我以为我们在接吻
And I thought, we're kissing.

584
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,217
我以为我们一直在接吻
I was thinking we were kissing the whole time,

585
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,426
就像以一种不好的方式
like in a bad way

586
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:03,097
当你过得不开心的时候
where you aren't having a good time,

587
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,057
就像某人的嘴一样
and it's just like someone's mouth.

588
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,352
然后我说
And then I said,

589
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,396
“我真的不认为我准备好接吻了
"I don't really think I'm ready to be kissing.

590
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,064
我刚刚摆脱了一件事 ”
I just got out of a thing."

591
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,859
这是我编造的
Which is something I made up.

592
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,443
对此撒谎是可以的
It's okay to lie about that.

593
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,571
然后他说 “没关系 ”
And then he said, "That's okay."

594
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,492
“我们可以坐在沙发上看电影 ”
"We can just sit on the couch and watch a movie."

595
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,121
于是他开始玩一些东西
So he started playing something.

596
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,207
它是动画的 我认为这很奇怪
It was animated, which I thought was weird.

597
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,417
但后来我想起他有个孩子
But then I remembered he has a kid,

598
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,836
这样就没那么奇怪了
so that made it less weird.

599
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,299
然后他开始把手放在我的裤子上
Then he started putting his hand on my pants,

600
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,386
我正把它移开
and I was kinda moving it away.

601
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,557
但他一直把它移回我的裤子里
But he kept moving it back to my pants,

602
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,978
然后他开始把手伸进我的裤子里 就像
and then he started putting his hand down my pants, like,

603
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,105
在裤子和内衣之间
in between the pants and my underwear.

604
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,610
我的身体扭动得像……
And I was kinda squirming my body like...

605
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,445
他是……
he was...

606
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,117
他的手指非常有力且坚硬
his fingers were really strong and hard,

607
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,454
就像 以不好的方式
like, in the bad way.

608
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,663
就像 这太难了
Like, it was too hard.

609
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,585
也许感觉会很好
Maybe it would've felt good

610
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,086
如果我希望他的手指能做到这一点
if I wanted his fingers to be doing that.

611
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,296
但你并不想要那样
But you didn't want that.

612
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,505
不 我没有
No, I didn't.

613
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,971
然后 我把他的手拉了出来 因为……
And then, I pulled his hand out because...

614
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,059
感觉不太好
it didn't feel good,

615
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,560
而且确实有点疼
and it actually hurt, kinda.

616
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,606
然后我开始亲吻他
And then I started kissing him

617
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,901
因为我认为
because I thought,

618
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,779
“好吧 如果我们必须做点什么的话 ”
"Well, if we have to be doing something,"

619
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,740
“我宁愿亲吻 也不愿他的手指伸进去 ”
"I'd rather it be kissing than his fingers down there."

620
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,122
然后我就不记得了
And then I don't remember.

621
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:02,758
然后在某个时刻
And then at some point,

622
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,760
他的手又伸进了我的内裤
his hand was back in my underwear.

623
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,094
但现在在内衣下面
But under the underwear now.

624
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,391
我又试图把它移开
And I was trying to move it away again.

625
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,601
听起来你曾多次试图将它移开
Sounds like you were trying to move it away a lot.

626
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,269
是的 我一直这么想
Yeah. That's what I kept thinking.

627
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,731
就像 再来一次 他就不会再把它移回去
Like, one more time and he won't move it back

628
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,691
因为它太明显了 所以我把它移开了
because it's so obvious I'm moving it away.

629
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,861
但他一直将其移回
But he kept moving it back.

630
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,824
进而...
And then...

631
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,035
他正在拉下我的裤子……
he was pulling down my pants...

632
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,745
嗯 他试图把它们拉下来
Well, he was trying to pull them down,

633
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,122
但它们有一个按钮
but they have a button.

634
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,292
所以他一直拉啊拉
So he was pulling, pulling.

635
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,753
我把它们拉了回来
And I was pulling them back up.

636
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,756
然后他们就走到了半山腰
And then they were halfway down.

637
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,928
我感觉有什么东西进入了我的体内
And I felt something go in, like, in me,

638
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,516
我的脊椎开始发凉
and my spine got cold.

639
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,230
我伸手去摸它 然后……
And I reached down to feel it and...

640
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,149
这是……
It was...

641
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,027
就是他……你知道吗？
It was him... you know?

642
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,325
然后我跳了起来......
And then I jumped up and...

643
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,744
我坐在沙发边上
I sat on the side of the couch.

644
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,746
我不知道要多久
I don't know how long.

645
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,336
我看了一眼他的脸
And I looked at his face once,

646
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,550
它看起来好像很害怕
and it was, like, scared.

647
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,594
—他的脸上露出了害怕的表情？—是的
-His face was scared? -Yes.

648
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,644
然后我就慢慢地站了起来
And then I just got up kinda slowly,

649
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,314
我抓起靴子
and I grabbed my boots,

650
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,193
然后我开车回家
and I drove home,

651
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,990
现在我在这里
and now I'm here.

652
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,331
听起来像...
That sounds like...

653
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,002
那
that.

654
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,088
那是...
That is...

655
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,675
就是这样
that's the thing.

656
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,305
我真的非常非常抱歉
I'm really, really sorry.

657
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,934
我不知道我是否应该完全赤裸
I never know if I'm supposed to get fully naked.

658
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,602
—就像穿着长袍一样？—是的
-Like in the gown? -Yeah.

659
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,772
—你现在裸体吗？—是的
-Are you naked right now? -Yes.

660
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,858
兄弟 我认为你不应该裸体
Dude, I don't think you're supposed to be naked.

661
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,692
你好 你是艾格尼丝吗？
Hi. You're Agnes?

662
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,779
—是的 你好 —我是埃文斯医生
-Yeah, hi. -I'm doctor Evans.

663
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,325
你被性侵了吗？
You were sexually assaulted?

664
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,451
嗯 是的
Uh, yeah.

665
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,704
你现在觉得安全吗？
Do you feel safe now?

666
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:21,582
抱歉 在我们这样做之前
Sorry, before... uh, we do that,

667
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,425
我只是想让你知道我全身赤裸
I just want you to know that I'm fully naked.

668
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,128
-什么？-在长袍下面 可以吗？
-What? -Under the robe. Is that okay?

669
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,339
嗯 没问题
Yeah. That's fine.

670
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,427
—你介意吗？—当然可以
-Do you mind? -Yeah, sure.

671
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,181
那么 这是什么时候发生的？
So, when did this happen?

672
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,392
那件事？
The thing?

673
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,935
—袭击 —昨晚
-The assault. -Last night.

674
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,144
昨天晚上
Last evening.

675
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:44,646
昨天晚上
Yesterday evening.

676
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,232
—你洗澡了吗？—我洗了个澡
-And have you showered? -I took a bath.

677
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,984
所以最好去急诊室
So it's usually best to go to the emergency room

678
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,819
就在这样的事情发生之后
right after something like this happens.

679
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,613
哦好的
Oh, okay.

680
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,406
下次我一定会记住这一点
I will definitely keep that in mind for the next time.

681
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,490
嗯 这时候我们会用
Well, that's when we would use

682
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,075
性侵犯法医证据工具包
a sexual assault forensic evidence kit.

683
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,952
哦 好的 我觉得你只需要……
Oh, okay. I feel like you just need to...

684
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,287
音调上偏离了音调
tonally shift away from the tone

685
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,206
你现在正在服用
you're taking right now.

686
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,957
就像 我们只是需要音调的转变
Like, we just need a tonal shift.

687
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,084
只是想确认他没有给我任何东西
Just wanna make sure he didn't give me anything,

688
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,877
比如 阴道或者
like, vaginally or yeah.

689
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,466
袭击者在你体内射精了吗？
Did your attacker ejaculate in you?

690
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,260
嗯 我不会称他为袭击我的人
Um, well, I wouldn't call him my attacker.

691
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,179
这不像是 呸！
It wasn't like, bah!

692
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,347
但你被强奸了
But you were raped.

693
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,473
—哇哦 —是的
-Whoa. -Yeah.

694
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:20,641
说得好
And well put.

695
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,517
我知道这很难说
I know this is hard to talk about.

696
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,313
感觉你不知道这一点
It doesn't feel that you know that.

697
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,689
这些问题是礼仪问题
These questions are protocol.

698
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,025
是的 你问他们的方式真的很怪异
Yeah, you're asking them in a really freaky way.

699
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,360
冷静一下 女士
Calm down, ma'am.

700
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,778
—哦 她很冷静 —我很冷静
-Oh, she's calm. -I'm calm.

701
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,196
你可以继续提问了
You can finish your questions.

702
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,490
他射精到你体内了吗？
Did he ejaculate in you?

703
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,158
可怕的词
Horrible word.

704
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,327
不 他实际上在我体内
No, the actual him being inside me part

705
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,037
没过多久 就像……
wasn't that long, it was like...

706
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:47,000
—那么久 —好的
-that long. -Okay.

707
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:51,046
所以 我们会进行血液检查 检查你是否怀孕
So, we'll do a blood test to check you for pregnancy

708

以及性传播感染

00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,969
然后我们会进行宫颈培养

德克尔正在转学

他要走了

719
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:34,964

720
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,133
搞什么鬼？

00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,680
不

723
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,682
也许吧 我不知道

724
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,520
他对此有何评论？
Did he say anything about this?

725
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,814
不
No.

726
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,194
昨天他的办公桌非常乱
And yesterday his desk was, like, really cluttered.

727
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
就像他没有打包任何东西一样
Like he wasn't packed or anything.

728
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,575
所以他正在跑步
So he's running.

729
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:06,996
他妈的
Fuck.

你介意跟我们一起回去吗？
Do you mind coming back with us?

734
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:23,740
当然

735
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,457
得知您遭遇此事 我们深感抱歉
We are so sorry to hear this happened to you.

736
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,958
我们正在采取这一行动
We are taking this

737
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,377
真的很认真

738
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,595
你会做什么吗？
Are you gonna do anything?

739
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,556
我们将开始调查

740
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,934
但正如你可能听说的那样
But as you may have heard,

741
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,686
他昨天在……递交了辞职信

742
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,648
下午 4:18

00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,902
您于今天上午 8:42 报告了此事
And you reported this today at 8:42 am.

744
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,321
好的
Okay.

745
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,783
不幸的是 他不再受雇于我们了
Unfortunately, he's no longer under our employ.

746
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,786
因此我们不能采取通常采取的措施
So we can't take the measures that we would normally take

747
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,830
比如暂停他或者解雇他或者……
such as suspending him or letting him go or...

748
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,208
类似这样的事情

749
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,378
这些事情真的很难
These things are really hard,

750
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:21,465
不幸的是 大学无法
and the University is unfortunately unable

751
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:24,718
承担任何责任
to take any kind of responsibility.

752
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,553
但他是我的顾问

753
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,265
前任顾问
Former advisor.

754
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:35,312
您可以选择
You have the option

755
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,856
去警察局报案
of going to the police station and reporting this

756
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:40,108
并发出逮捕令
and issuing an arrest warrant.

757
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:50,243

对不起 我只是想把自己封闭起来

比如他的头发或者他的笔或者别的什么

I told the neighbor, it's like this whole big lie.

840
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,387
我陷入了谎言之中
I'm stuck in a lie.

841
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,724
好的 我会做的
Okay. I will do it.

842
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,518
—对不起 —不 没关系
-I'm sorry. -No, it's fine.

843
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:09,771
我本来要去杀一个人 所以这容易多了
I was gonna, like, kill a man, so this is much easier.

844
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,522

850
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,132
这真是太好了
This is really nice.

851
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:04,427

00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,451
你在撒谎
You're lying.

对于那些还没有这样做的人
For those of you who haven't done this

876
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,304
不知道会发生什么

你可以走了

893
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,835
富勒夫人 您觉得呢？
And do you think, Mrs. Fuller,

894
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,254
根据该定义
based on that definition,

895
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:33,881
你明白“排除合理怀疑”的意思吗？
you understand the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt?

896
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,549
是的
Yes.

897
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,343
毫无疑问地确信
That to be convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt,

898
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:38,386
你一定去过那里
you must have been there

899
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,054
并亲眼目睹了犯罪行为？
and seen the crime with your own eyes?

900
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,764
是的 我明白
Yes. I understand.

901
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,140
你们其他人是否觉得
And do the rest of you feel

902
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,977
你可以应用这个想法 毫无疑问
you can apply that idea, beyond a reasonable doubt,

903
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,353
—对于这个案子？—嗯
-to this case? -Mhmm.

904
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:48,996
你们当中有多少人有孩子？
How many of you have children?

905
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,191
呃 沃加德先生
Uh, Mr. Woguard.

906
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,317
你有孩子吗？
You have a child?

907
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,153
嗯 是的 索菲刚满四岁
Uh, yes. Soph just turned four.

908
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,072
假设你和你的女儿在公园
Say you and your daughter were at the park

909
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,448
她正在玩攀爬架
and she's playing on the monkey bars.

910
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,367
你转过身去几分钟
And you turned your back for a few minutes,

911
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,702
然后她就带着断掉的手臂跑向你
and then she runs over to you with a broken arm.

912
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:05,871
您认为会发生什么？
What would you think happened?

913
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:07,206
她从攀爬架上摔了下来
She fell off the monkey bars

914
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,165
并打断了她的手臂
and broke her arm.

915
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,625
是的 这是一个例子
Yes, so that's an example

916
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,544
间接证据
of circumstantial evidence.

917
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,129
这就是你可以合理推断的
That's what you can reasonably infer

918
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,256
根据你所掌握的事实
based on the facts that you have.

919
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,924
这有道理吗 沃加德先生？
Does this make sense, Mr. Woguard?

920
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:18,551
是的
Yes.

921
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:21,178
如果另一个孩子跑向你
And if instead another child ran over to you

922
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:24,765
并告诉你他看到她从攀爬架上摔下来
and told you he saw her fall off the monkey bars,

923
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,350
这是直接的证词
that's direct testimony

924
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,644
因为有人目睹了这一切
because someone witnessed it.

925
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,063
大家明白这个区别吗？
Does everybody understand that difference,

926
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,107
间接证据之间
between circumstantial evidence

927
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,608
和直接证词？
and direct testimony?

928
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,027
嗯
Mhmm.

929
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,486
在没有直接证词的情况下
Without direct testimony,

930
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,530
我们不能肯定
we cannot be positively certain

931
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,324
犯罪已经发生
a crime has been committed.

932
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:42,825
正如检方所说
As the prosecution,

933
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,702
我必须证明被告有罪
I must prove the defendant's guilt

934
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,454
毫无合理怀疑
beyond a reasonable doubt.

935
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:49,832
意思是 没有其他合理的解释
Meaning, that there is no other reasonable explanation

936
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,043
这可以从所提供的证据中得出
that can come from evidence presented.

937
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,503
如果你们当中有人成为犯罪的受害者
If any of you have been victims of a crime,

938
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:56,046
请举手
please raise your hand.

939
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:00,176
呃 费伯先生 犯罪内容是什么？
Uh, Mr. Faber, what was the crime?

940
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,345
呃 我被抢劫了 被枪指着
Uh, I was robbed. At gunpoint.

941
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:03,679
你有什么理由相信
Do you have any reason to believe

942
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,431
这段经历会让你无法服务
that experience would make you unable to serve

943
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:07,808
作为本次审判的公正陪审员？
as an impartial juror on this trial?

944
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,059
不
No.

945
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,146
沃德小姐
Miss Ward.

946
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:14,440
什么？
What?

947
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,484
当我问谁是犯罪的受害者时
When I asked who has been a victim of a crime,

948
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:17,485
你举手了吗？
did you raise your hand?

949
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:20,071
不 我意识到我不应该分享它
No, I realized I shouldn't share it.

950
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,614
所以...
So...

951
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,699
你不能分担罪行吗？
You're unable to share the crime?

952
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,201
一...
Um...

953
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,996
坦白说这是我最可怕的噩梦
It is frankly my worst nightmare

954
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,539
必须告诉整个房间的陌生人
to have to tell this whole room of strangers

955
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:32,082
关于发生在我身上的事
about the thing that happened to me.

956
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:33,876
所以...
So...

957
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:37,463
这就是我没有决定的原因
that is the reasoning as to why I did not decide

958
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,632
继续举手
to continue having my hand raised.

959
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:40,716
谢谢
Thank you.

960
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:45,471
你认为该罪行会导致你无法服役
Do you think the crime would make you unable to serve

961
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,973
作为此案的公正陪审员？
as an impartial juror on this case?

962
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,433
这是个好问题
That is a good question,

963
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,393
这也是我一直在思考的问题
and one I've been thinking about.

964
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,523
你得出什么结论了吗？
Have you come to any conclusions?

965
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,108
你知道 我想我会更好
You know, I think I would be better

966
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,568
不在陪审团中
not being on the jury

967
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:00,611
反而会做得更好
and instead would do better

968
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,696
履行不同的公民角色
fulfilling a different civic role.

969
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,991
您心目中的公民角色是什么样的？
And what kind of civic role do you have in mind?

970
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:07,493
所以 谢谢你的提问
So, thank you for asking.

971
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,661
我其实是一名教授
I am actually a professor,

972
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,707
兼职 希望很快能成为全职
part-time, hopefully soon full-time,

973
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,668
其中 教学是重要的工作
which, teaching is important work.

974
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:17,962
我认为教学很重要
I think teaching is important.

975
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,673
有人会说老师是理想的陪审员
Some would say that a teacher makes an ideal juror.

976
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:23,467
绝对不是 不是
Absolutely not, no.

977
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,178
在您的问卷上 您写道……
On your questionnaire, you wrote...

978
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,471
哦 不 不
Oh, no, no.

979
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,224
我不知道我们会大声朗读这些 所以
I did not know that we would be reading those aloud, so.

980
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,143
“你的朋友会如何形容你？”
"How would your friends describe you?"

981
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:33,102
“聪明的 ”
"Smart."

982
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,062
划掉“tall”这个词
Crossed out, then the word "tall."

983
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,110
如果你所遭受的犯罪行为使你产生偏见
If the crime you were a victim of makes you biased,

984
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,277
我们将解雇你
we will dismiss you.

985
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,574
我告诉你这件事会惹上麻烦吗？
Can I get in trouble for telling you?

986
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:48,993
如果你是受害者 为什么你会遇到麻烦？
Why would you get in trouble if you were the victim?

987
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,244
我不知道
I don't know.

988
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,746
我认为这项法律毫无意义
The law makes no sense in my opinion.

989
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,419
我...
I...

990
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,968
事实上我之前没有大声说过
I haven't said it out loud actually before.

991
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,177
嗯 没关系
Well, that's okay.

992
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,137
你去报警了吗？
Did you go to the police?

993
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,515
不
No.

994
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:12,891
我只有一个按钮
All I had was a button,

995
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,686
我不想让他进监狱

—你感觉不舒服吗？—是的
-Do you feel bad at all? -Yes.

1137
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:30,722
但是 是因为其他原因 而不是因为这个
But, for other reasons, not because of this.

1138
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,140
好的 嗯...
Okay, well, um...

1139
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,475
只是因为事情对你来说很容易
just because things come easy to you

1140
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,060
并不意味着你可以从别人那里拿走东西
doesn't mean that you get to take things from people

1141
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:36,436
事情来之不易
who things don't come easy to.

1142
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,646
对我来说事情并不容易
Things don't come easy to me.

1143
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:39,898
是的 大家都喜欢你
Yes they do. Everyone likes you.

1144
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,692
—你很聪明 你很性感 —谢谢你
-You're smart, you're hot. -Thank you.

1145
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:42,943
呃 不是那样的
Ew, not like that.

1146
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,695
洛根喜欢你 德文也喜欢你
Logan likes you, Devin likes you.

1147
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:45,904
Lydie 喜欢你
Lydie likes you.

1148
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:47,530
德克尔喜欢你
Decker likes you.

1149
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,619
嗯 你不喜欢我
Well, you don't like me.

1150
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,004
这是真的
That's true.

1151
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,590
这是真的
That's true.

1152
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,306
你知道 当我想到这一点时
You know, when I think about it,

1153
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,893
我认为德克尔实际上恨我
I think Decker actually hated me.

1154
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:18,645
你是他选中的人
You were his chosen one.

1155
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,147
这真是太疯狂了
That's a completely insane thing to say.

1156
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,106
不
No.

1157
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:23,066
因为当你喜欢某人或者
Because when you like someone or, like,

1158
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:25,860
当你尊重某人时
when you respect someone,

1159
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,198
人们对待你的方式有些不同
there are some ways people treat you

1160
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,159
这是一种方法
that are one way.

1161
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,119
尊重 并且喜欢
Respectful, and like,

1162
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:37,581
你是一个活着、呼吸着的人
you're a person who lives and breathes

1163
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:39,290
并独立思考
and thinks for them self.

1164
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:44,963
但有些人对待你的方式却不是那样的
And then some ways people treat you are not that way,

1165
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,214
而且它们很糟糕
and they're bad.

1166
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,347
好吧 嗯 我和他上床了……
All right. Well, um, I fucked him...

1167
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,058
他甚至没有花时间
and, uh, he didn't even take the time

1168
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:58,852
亲自给我论文做笔记 所以……
to give me in-person notes on my thesis. So...

1169
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,980
你跟他上床了？
You fucked him?

1170
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:03,648
是的
Yeah.

1171
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,985
你想要那个吗？
Did you want that?

1172
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,278
想要啥？
Want what?

1173
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,700
是故意的吗？
Was it on purpose?

1174
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,118
是的 这是故意的
Yes, it was on purpose.

1175
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,455
我们进行了大约五分钟的性爱
We had, like, five minute sex.

1176
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:20,290
还行吧 我吃过更好的了
It was just okay. I've had better.

1177
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,744
我们关门了 这里不能停车
We're closed. You can't park here.

1178
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:01,998
哦 糟糕 哦 糟糕
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1179
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,375
听着 我很抱歉对你大喊大叫
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1180
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:08,046
我的孩子汉克也会出现呼吸困难的情况
My kid, Hank, gets these breathing attacks too,

1181
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,297
有时真的很糟糕
real bad sometimes.

1182
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:12,134
我知道你很害怕
I know you're scared,

1183
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:14,427
但你已经离开了道路 坐在车里
but you're off the road, you're in your car,

1184
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,429
你没事
and you're okay.

1185
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,266
我要呼吸 你也和我一起呼吸
I'm gonna breathe and you breathe with me.

1186
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,725
好吗？你跟着就行
Okay? You just follow.

1187
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,310
好吗？准备好了吗？在……
All right? You ready? In...

1188
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,858
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1189
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:29,275
在...
In...

1190
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,614
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1191
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:35,740
在...
In...

1192
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:41,204
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1193
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,498
在...二、三
In... two, three.

1194
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:45,417
出去...
Out...

1195
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,628
二、三、四、五
Two, three, four, five.

1196
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:51,590
我必须说实话
I gotta be honest,

1197
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:52,757
我不太会这样呼吸
I don't really breathe like that,

1198
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,967
但感觉很好
but it feels good.

1199
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:56,094
你还好吗？
You doing okay?

1200
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:57,971
对你有好处
Good for you.

1201
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:00,932
你想要一个三明治吗？
You want a sandwich?

1202
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,736
我想在这里摆放桌子
I wanted to put tables out here

1203
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:14,862
所以 你知道 人们不会坐在地上
so, people, you know, wouldn't sit on the ground.

1204
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,407
这是一个美味的三明治
It's a good sandwich.

1205
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:19,701
你不应该吃一个好三明治
You shouldn't eat a good sandwich

1206
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:20,869
当你坐在地上时
while you're sitting on the ground

1207
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:22,036
鸽子拉屎的地方
where the pigeons shit.

1208
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,663
任何
Whatever.

1209
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,790
但他们说 你们共享一个……
But they said, you share a...

1210
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,626
垃圾场里有停车场
a parking lot with the guys at the dump.

1211
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:29,544
所以你得问问垃圾场的人
So you gotta ask the guys at the dump.

1212
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:32,547
我才不会问垃圾场里的人呢！
No fucking way I'm asking the guys at the dump!

1213
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:36,884
他妈的混蛋
Fucking assholes.

1214
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,138
这很好
This is good.

1215
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,639
是的 当然好
Yeah, of course it's good.

1216
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:44,267
你没有三明治店
You don't have a sandwich shop,

1217
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,685
你做的三明治不太好
you don't make a good sandwich.

1218
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:48,396
辛辣的
Spicy.

1219
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,732
卡拉布里亚辣椒 非常昂贵
Calabrian chili, very expensive.

1220
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:54,319
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

1221
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,279
咦？
Huh?

1222
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,948
—艾格尼丝？—是的
-Agnes? -Yeah.

1223
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:02,577
-呃 -哇哦
-Ugh. -Whoa,

1224
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,537
你们听起来就像垃圾堆里来的坏人
you sound like the mean guys from the dump.

1225
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,249
嘿！我……我对此感到不满
Hey! I res... I resent that.

1226
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:10,126
那些家伙都是混蛋 说实话 我不是混蛋
Those guys are assholes. I'm honest, not an asshole.

1227
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,005
你有个儿子？
You have a son?

1228
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:15,882
他是个混蛋
He's an asshole.

1229
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,259
汉克
Hank.

1230
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,888
—汉克是……—呃……
-Hank is... -Ugh...

1231
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,807
你不必告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

1232
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,850
听起来太像“honk”这个词了
Sounds too much like the word honk.

1233
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,062
—你有孩子吗？—没有
-You have kids? -No.

1234
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,565
想要一些吗？
Want some?

1235
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,986
呃……好吧 我真的无法想象自己变老
Uh... Well, I can't really imagine myself old.

1236
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,322
你以为我想象中的自己是这样的吗？
You think I imagined myself like this?

1237
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,575
不 不管你信不信
No, believe it or not,

1238
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,910
我没有想到我会
I did not think I would end up

1239
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,120
看上去就像一个有嘴的山药
looking like a yam with a mouth on it.

1240
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,499
但我们就在这儿
But here we are.

1241
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:51,918
这也会发生在你身上
It'll happen to you.

1242
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,129
你不会知道是什么击中了你
You won't know what hit you.

1243
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,595
我遇到了一件非常糟糕的事情
Something pretty bad happened to me,

1244
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,806
这可能就是我行为怪异的原因
so that's probably why I'm acting weird.

1245
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,017
有多糟糕？
How bad?

1246
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,186
一...
Um...

1247
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:11,813
我想真的很糟糕
I guess really bad.

1248
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,941
你不知道这很糟糕吗？
You don't know it's bad?

1249
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,487
不 我知道这很糟糕
No, I know it's bad.

1250
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,242
但主要是因为每当我告诉别人这件事时
But mainly because whenever I tell anyone about it,

1251
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,495
他们看起来真的为我感到害怕
they look really scared for me.

1252
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,248
除了我的朋友 但她搬走了
Except for my friend, but she moved away.

1253
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,419
有时候我一想到这件事就觉得难过
And then sometimes I feel bad when I think about it,

1254
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:36,462
因为...
because...

1255
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:39,340
我记得那些时刻
I remember moments of it,

1256
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:44,804
我可以感觉到我的身体
and I can feel in my body

1257
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,598
那真的很糟糕
that it was really bad.

1258
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,770
但有时我不会去想它
But then sometimes I don't think about it,

1259
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:52,937
这很奇怪
which is weird.

1260
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,567
当我不去想这件事时 我就会感到内疚
And I feel guilty when I don't think about it.

1261
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:01,821
刚刚发生的事吗？
Did it just happen?

1262
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,504
这就是你气喘吁吁的原因吗？
Is that why you were huffing and puffing?

1263
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,993
不 是三...
No, it was three...

1264
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,746
三年前
a little over three years ago.

1265
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,456
嗯 时间并不多
Well, that's not that much time.

1266
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,458
我的意思是 这需要很多时间
I mean, it's a lot of time,

1267
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:16,586
但时间也不多了
but it's not that much time, too.

1268
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,338
是的
Yeah.

1269
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,635
你是...
Are you...

1270
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,055
你家还好吗？
okay in your house?

1271
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,017
我有一只猫
I have a cat.

1272
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,436
好的
Okay.

1273
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:51,746
奥尔加 这到底是怎么回事？
Olga, what the fuck?

1274
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,665
奥尔加 去睡觉吧
Olga, go to bed.

1275
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:58,419
呃 奥尔加 你在我的床上拉屎了吗？

哦！一个包 一个包！我有一个包！
Oh! A bag, a bag! I got a bag!

Get in the bag.

1289

1296
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,219
艾格尼丝 你还好吗？
Agnes, are you okay?

1297
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:33,556
艾格尼丝？什么……
Agnes? What...

1298
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:36,183
你还好嗎？
Are you okay?

1299
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,979
你会来操我嗎？
Will you come fuck me?

1300
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,690
是的
Yes.

1301
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,400
等一下 等一下 我需要鞋子
Wait, wait. I need shoes.

1302
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,864
我嗯……我确实需要鞋子
I um... I do need shoes.

1303
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,283
一秒钟
One second.

1304
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:12,947
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

1305
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,032
我可以小便吗？
Can I pee?

1306
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:15,366
哦 是的 当然
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

1307
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,810
我可以进去吗？
Can I get in?

1308
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:44,896
哦 在洗澡吗？
Oh, in the bath?

1309
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,063
是的
Yeah.

1310
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:48,649
呃 当然
Uh, sure.

1311
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,160
我只是要在这里转一圈
I'm just gonna turn around here.

1312
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,369
别介意我
Don't mind me.

1313
01:24:01,162 --> 01:24:02,288
你不必隐藏它
You don't have to hide it.

1314
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:05,916
现在还很小
It's small right now.

1315
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:08,419
男人真是奇怪
Men are so weird.

1316
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:11,213
谢谢
Thank you.

1317
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,514
噢 那太好了
Oh, that's nice.

1318
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:23,267
温度适宜
It's a good temperature.

1319
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,477
谢谢
Thank you.

1320
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,483
我对自己隐藏自己的阴茎感到很尴尬
I'm embarrassed that I was hiding my dick.

1321
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,361
没关系
That's okay.

1322
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:35,237
我把头发放在胸部上
I put my hair over my boobs.

1323
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:37,698
如此真实
So true.

1324
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:46,999
抱歉 浴缸太小了
I'm sorry the bathtub is so small.

1325
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:49,752
这个浴缸？
This bathtub?

1326
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:51,629
不 很好
No, it's good.

1327
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,842
如果我坐在你后面呢？
What if I sat behind you?

1328
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,471
—为什么？—那么 呃……
-Why? -So, uh...

1329
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:02,056
它可能就像一个拥抱
it could be like a hug.

1330
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:06,769
好的
Okay.

1331
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,354
-是啊是啊
-Yeah? -Yeah.

1332
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:13,526
哦 等等 我可以看看吗？
Oh, wait. Can I look at it?

1333
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:15,778
嗎？
At my dick?

1334
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:17,738
是的
Yeah.

1335
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,458
唔...
Hmm...

1336
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,793
我从未见过如此柔软的
I've never seen one that soft.

1337
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,879
好吧 我觉得那只是让我做了恶梦
Okay, I think that just gave me nightmares

1338
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,130
未来十年
for the next decade.

1339
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:37,007
不 我的意思是 你永远不可能看到他们那样
No, I mean, you just never get to see them like that.

1340
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,178
他们这样会更好
They're better like this.

1341
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:45,516
唔...
Hmm...

1342
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,064
好的 我说完了
Okay, I'm done.

1343
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,244
毫米
Mm.

1344
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:09,456
毫米
Mm.

1345
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:17,089
你以为你想要每个人都有的东西吗？
Do you think you want the stuff that everyone has?

1346
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,466
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

1347
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,053
就像 呃
Like, uh,

1348
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:23,888
家庭或者其他什么的 我不知道
family or whatever. I don't know.

1349
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:27,975
你想要那些东西吗？
Do you want that stuff?

1350
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:29,977
与你？
With you?

1351
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,061
不
No.

1352
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,772
不 我的意思是 这是你的问题
No, I mean, it was your question.

1353
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:36,442
是的 我想要那个东西
Yeah. I want that stuff.

1354
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,069
好的
Nice.

1355
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:41,447
你？
Do you?

1356
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,991
出色地...
Well...

1357
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:48,329
你知道 可能只是为了让 Lydie 更亲近一些……
You know, probably just to keep Lydie closer...

1358
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,541
但我没有看到
but I don't see it.

1359
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:55,962
在哪里看到？
See it where?

1360
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,296
就像在我的脑海里一样
Like, in my head.

1361
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:02,343
我不认为自己会变老或者有孩子
I don't see myself getting older or having kids.

1362
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,262
我看不到我自己
I don't see myself.

1363
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,391
我认为你会是一位伟大的妈妈
I think you'd be a great mom.

1364
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:12,770
为什么？
Why?

1365
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,147
您非常友善
You're very nice.

1366
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,235
我没那么好
I'm not that nice.

1367
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,201
人们总是说他们不想要孩子
People always say they don't want a kid,

1368
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,912
但后来情况发生了变化
but then things change.

1369
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,332
我们想要什么等等...
What we want and stuff...

1370
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,584
我认为它会改变
I think it changes.

1371
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:45,719
太冷了
It's too cold.

1372
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,099
我认为这很好
I think it's nice.

1373
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:30,097
嗨！耶！

1389

1394
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,051

Fran, we're free! We're free.

1452
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,283
灯塔非常浪漫
The lighthouse is very romantic.

1453
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,536
你们两个应该单独在一起

1454

再生一个孩子或者其他什么的

大概二十分钟 就是这样
Like, twenty minutes, that's it.

1456
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:45,584
有一个问题 如果她杀了我怎么办？

1457
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,085
她不会杀了你的

1458
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:55,969

1470
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:28,878
我该对她说什么呢？
What do I say to her?

1471
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,462
宝贝 你什么也不用说
Babe, you don't have to say anything.

1472
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:32,506
二十分钟
Twenty minutes.

1473
01:33:04,997 --> 01:33:06,039
你好

1474

我是艾格尼丝
I'm Agnes.

1475
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:13,297
很奇怪有一天你会成为一个人
Pretty weird you're gonna be a person someday.

1476
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:18,385
无意冒犯 但你现在看上去很疯狂
No offense, but you look insane right now.

1477
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,804
皮肤和少量毛发
Skin and just a small amount of hair.

1478
01:33:22,556 --> 01:33:23,974
不用担心
Don't worry.

1479
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:26,685
不久之后就不会这样了
It won't be like that in a little.

1480
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:34,651
这样可以吗或者...
Is this okay or...

1481
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,542
好的
All right.

1482
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,254
我就把你放下来
I'll put you down.

1483
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:54,838
哦 我去接你
Oh. I'll pick you back up.

1484
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:56,840
好的 好的 好的
Okay, okay, okay.

1485
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:23,408
你看上去真甜美
You're so sweet looking.

1486
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:42,302
等你长大了 什么都可以告诉我
When you grow up, you can tell me whatever.

1487
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,098
比如 如果你有一个想法
Like, if you have a thought

1488
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,600
你会觉得这个想法很糟糕
and you're like, that's a bad thought,

1489
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:52,562
我可能也有同样的想法 但是
I probably had that same thought but, like,

1490
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,815
糟糕十倍
ten times worse.

1491
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:58,276
所以你直接告诉我就可以了
So you can just tell me.

1492
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:01,530
我永远不会被这个吓到
I'll never be scared by that.

1493
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:09,287
如果有人对你做了坏事……
If someone does something bad to you...

1494
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:12,958
如果有人说了一些可怕的事情......
If someone says something scary...

1495
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:17,880
如果你想自杀
If you wanna kill yourself

1496
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:20,382
用铅笔或者小刀或者其他什么东西
with like a pencil or a knife or whatever,

1497
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:24,636
你可以直接告诉我
you can just tell me.

1498
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:30,642
我永远不会告诉你你让我害怕
I'll never tell you you're scaring me.

1499
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,521
我只能说 是的
I'll just say, yeah.

1500
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,398
我知道
I know.

1501
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:39,234
有时候就是这样
It's just like that sometimes.

1502
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:41,695
是的
Yeah.

1503
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:46,616
对不起
I'm sorry

1504
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:49,828
不好的事情将会发生在你身上
that bad things are gonna happen to you.

1505
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,833
我希望他们不会
I hope they don't.

1506
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,585
如果我能阻止某件事变坏
If I can ever stop something from being bad,

1507
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:57,752
让我知道
let me know.

1508
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:03,383
但有时糟糕的事情就会发生
But sometimes bad stuff just happens.

1509
01:36:07,304 --> 01:36:09,055
这就是为什么我为你感到难过
That's why I feel bad for you,

1510
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,141
在某种程度上
in a way.

1511
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:16,354
你还活着 但你还不知道这一点
That you're alive and you don't know that yet.

1512
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,073
但我仍然可以听
But I can still listen

1513
01:36:29,075 --> 01:36:30,410
不要害怕
and not be scared.

1514
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:36,750
这很好
So that's good.

1515
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:41,213
或者至少是这样的
Or that's something, at least.

12
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,920
你竟然还住在这儿
I cannot believe you still live here.

13
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,880
嗯 你每次都这么说
Yeah, well, you say that every time.

14
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,380
手都冻麻了 啊 该死的
I can't feel my fucking hands, ah! shit me.

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,990
我来拿吧 让我来拿
Let me take that. Let me take that.

16
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,760
可重了
It's really heavy.

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,330
是啊 重的要命
Yeah, fuck, it is heavy.

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,470
里面是给我带的礼物吗？
Did you bring me presents?

19
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,240
哦 不是 就一大堆袜子
Oh, no, just like eighteen pairs of socks.

20
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,430
这儿有的是袜子
I have socks.

21
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,880
是 但宝贝你的尺码太大了
Yeah, but your feet are huge, babe.

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,930
{\an8}“宝贝”相伴的时光

23
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,980
可真重呀
It's really heavy.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,630
天呐
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,840
-我是这么想的 -嗯
-This is what I think. -Yeah.

26
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,400
跟男人做爱的时候...
When you are having sex with a guy...

27
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,420
嗯
Yeah.

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,220
-有时... -嗯哼
-Sometimes... -Mhmm.

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,430
他们会突然冒出句...
They are saying stuff like,

30
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,810
“喜欢吧”
"You like that."

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,030
嗯？
Mhmm.

32
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,840
就知道你喜欢
You like that.

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,800
嗯 到底啥意思
Mhmm. What is that, even?

34
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,850
对
Right.

35
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,970
哦 懂了 太爹味了
Oh, that's deep.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,310
我觉得 他们是说...
I think... I think they mean

37
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,060
说我喜欢...
you like...

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,090
-那玩意儿 -那玩意儿
-That. -That.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,210
-对 说你喜欢他吊 -那东西
-Yeah. "You like my dick." -Or that.

40
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,780
就好像 他们把那玩意儿当成是自己的一切
But it's like, they like, it's like, also their dick is their whole self.

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,090
“喜欢我吊吧”等同于“喜欢我吧”
So they're like, "Do you like the dick? Do you like me?"

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,290
-“爱我吧” -得了吧
-"Do you love me?" -"Do you love me!"

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,500
那意思是“用我的吊爱你”
"And I am fucking you with my dick."

44
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,400
对
Right.

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,900
那爱就像...
And sometimes it's like...

46
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,100
别
Don't.

47
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,590
或者像...
No, sometimes it's like...

48
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,130
天呐
Oh, God.

49
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,130
有时像...
Sometimes it's like...

50
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,390
像吧
Kinda.

51
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,510
-可不是嘛 -像这...
-No. It is. -It's like...

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,960
有时感觉自己灵魂出窍 从他眼里...
Sometimes it's like you leave your mind and you're like, seeing it from, like,

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,220
-他的视角 -...看自己
-perspective behind. -Inside their brain.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,960
看自己屁股可怪了
Your butt looks weird.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,930
有时还...对 哈哈
Sometimes it's like... right!

56
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,770
那我什么时候能看？
So, are you gonna let me read it?

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,830
别急 还没好呢
Yeah. But it's not done.

58
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,330
连正式稿都算不上
It's not even a proper draft.

59
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,460
但总归是个稿子
But it's a draft.

60
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,670
可不是嘛
It's definitely a draft.

61
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,540
还是那种纽约同性恋题材吗？
Is it still about gay New York stuff?

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,700
对 不过这次更黑暗 偏心理化 也很幽默
Yeah, but now it's, like, dark and like psychological, but also funny.

63
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,840
我绝对要看
I will need to read that.

64
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,030
船来了！
Ahoy!

65
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,030
{\an9}Ahoy源自17世纪海员打招呼

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,470
他在跟我们说话吗？
Is that guy talking to us?

67
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,450
呃 他好像喊了句船来了
Ugh, I think he just said, "Ahoy."

68
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,360
嘿 邻居 船来了
Ahoy there, neighbor!

69
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,020
船来了
Ahoy!

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,780
唉 他占了我们的树
Ugh, he's in our spot.

71
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,540
天杀的
Fuckin' hell.

72
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,940
真想你还住在这儿
I wish you still lived here.

73
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,810
嗯
Yeah.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,960
哪怕住近点
Or closer, at least.

75
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,210
嗯 我也想你搬我那儿去
Yeah, I wish you lived closer to me too.

76
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,520
不过我还是喜欢这儿
I like it here, though.

77
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,650
你确定？
Are you sure?

78
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,950
怎么了？
Why?

79
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,080
压力很大 对吧？
It's a lot, right?

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,570
待在这里的话
Still being here.

81
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,040
在哪儿都不轻松
Well, it's a lot to be wherever.

82
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,220
嗯 的确
Yeah. That's true.

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,980
学校真让人
School was like...

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,300
-呃 让人作呕 -呃
-Ugh, Grad school was... -Ugh.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,080
没错
Exactly.

86
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,100
你结完婚还会想我吗？
Do you miss me even though you're married?

87
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,500
会呀 即便结了婚 还是会想你啊
Yes, I miss you even though I'm married.

88
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,620
都结婚了
Married.

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,910
-哎 -都变成大人了
-Ugh. -So grown up.

90
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,140
真变成大人了
It's so grown up.

91
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,350
嘿 嘿 那边的
Hey! Hey, you over there!

92

I'm married!

93
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,460
刚领过证了
I'm in a union that the state knows about!

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,730
我爸离婚了
My dad is divorced.

95
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,850
哦 真惨
Oh, that's sad.

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,590
没关系的
That's okay.

97

Well, what do we do now?

143
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,030
我得跟你说件事
I need to talk to you about something.

144
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,240
好
Okay.

145
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,930
嗯 是关于我身体的事
Okay. So it's about my body.

146
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,680
哦 你身材很棒
Oh, your body is perfect.

147
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
哦 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

148
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,250
但 呃 我不是那个意思
But, um, I didn't mean it like that.

149
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,440
好
Okay...

150
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,310
我肚子里有个孩子
So I have a baby in me.

151
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,230
-怀了？ -是啊
-You do? -Yeah.

152
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,400
什么？现在就怀了吗？
What? Right now?

153
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,660
现在
Right now.

154
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,960
-嗯 -真假的
-Yeah. -What?!

155
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,970
天呐
Oh, my God.

156
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,980
天呐 你的身体真是个奇迹
Oh, my God. Your body is a miracle.

157
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,480
天呐
Oh, my God.

158
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,990
你紧张吗？
Are you scared?

159
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,690
嗯 有点
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,320
但也很开心吧？
Oh, but are you glad?

161
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,450
嗯 是呀 挺好的
Yeah, yes. It's good.

162
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,640
显然这是我想要的
Like, I wanted it, obviously.

163
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,340
费了好大劲
Like, we tried a million times.

164
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,490
对 你确实想要
Yeah. You did want it.

165
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
-对 -利迪
-Yeah. -Lydie...

166
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,750
打算用我的名字吗？
Are you gonna name it Agnes?

167
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,430
哦
Oh.

168
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,750
嗯 我不知道 我不确定
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know.

169
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,290
别急着拒绝
Try and think about it.

170
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,130
捐的精子质量肯定不错
So it must have been good sperm.

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,670
对啊 幸好如此
Yeah. Thank God for that

172
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,440
某个高个儿白人的好精子
random, tall white guy's good sperm.

173
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,990
要不我也用他生个孩子
Maybe I should have his babies too

174
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,740
正好当兄弟
and then they can be brothers.

175
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,890
都是匿名的
Well, he's pretty hard to track down, so.

176
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,180
有照片嘛 能把他找出来
Well, we have his picture, so we could look him up.

177
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,840
能摸摸吗？
Can I touch it?

178
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,180
好啊
Yeah.

179
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,350
什么都感觉不到
I don't really feel anything.

180
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,470
因为还没长成个小宝宝
That's because it's not like a baby yet.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,580
多大了？
How old is it?

182
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,710
有十周吧
Ten weeks?

183
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,310
所以估计挺小的
So probably really small.

184
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,600
对
Yeah.

185
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,660
像小老鼠那么大？
What, like a mouse maybe?

186
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,950
老鼠有多大来着？
How big is a mouse?

187
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
哦 比那还小
Oh, it's smaller than that.

188
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,820
哇 竟然比老鼠小
Wow, smaller than a mouse.

189
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,860
今晚可别跟任何人提这个
Don't tell anyone tonight about...

190
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,050
放心吧
Oh, don't worry.

191
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,280
我从不乱说秘密
I never tell secrets

192
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,420
除非我真想讲
unless I feel it is a secret I really wanna tell.

193
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,820
这话听着一点也不让人放心 宝贝
That is not reassuring, babe.

194
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,270
我真不想去
I don't wanna go.

195
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,620
不行
No!

196
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,220
不行 得去 不然娜塔莎会把我宰了
No, we have to. Natasha will kill me.

197
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,570
我觉得 她给人感觉态度不好
I feel like... I feel like she's, like, rude,

198
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,670
说话带刺
like, tonally.

199
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,840
可不是 她讲话可刺人了
Oh, she definitely has a very rude tone.

200
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,820
对吧
Right?

201
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,920
她说话口气真有问题
She's got a really rude tone.

202
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,650
你怕吗？
Are you afraid?

203
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,650
有点
Yeah.

204
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,010
是怕疼吗？
For the pain?

205
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,450
是啊
Yeah.

206
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,650
但这是个独立的人啊
But also because it's like, a person.

207
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,060
我想养出个好人
I wanna make a really good person.

208
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,740
你会把孩子带成好人的
You're gonna make a good person.

209
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,320
会疼得要命的
It's gonna hurt so bad.

210
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,780
可不是 会疼死你的
Oh, my God, it seems like it hurts so bad!

211
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,180
不 别这么说
No! Don't say that.

212
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,350
我能说
I'm allowed to say that,

213
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,670
不许你说
you're not allowed to say that.

214
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,580
废话不说
Blah, blah, blah. Doesn't matter.

215
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,570
简而言之 房子买到了
Short story is, we got the house,

216
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,270
但花的比我们预期多得多
but we had to pay, like, significantly more than we wanted to.

217
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,840
喜欢这房子吧？我家的！
Do you like this house? My house?

218
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,820
嗯 挺喜欢的
I, I do. Yeah. Oh, my God.

219
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,770
木头 好有质感
The wood... it's gorgeous.

220
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,840
高档的 很奢华
It's rich. Like dark.

221
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,410
嗯
Yeah.

222
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,220
准备搬哪些东西来？
What are you gonna put in it?

223
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,450
-这房子？ -对
-In our house? -Yeah.

224
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,220
嗯 那沙发
Uh... our couch,

225
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,450
那床
our bed,

226
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,060
本尼父母给她的五斗柜
Benny's parents' dresser.

227
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,700
什么都搬来
All your stuff.

228
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,730
对 没错
Yes. Exactly.

229
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,730
果然
That makes sense.

230
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,430
你现在真的长大了
You're like a fully fledged adult now.

231
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,470
大伙儿 我们有多久没聚了？
Guys, how long has it been since, like, we've hung out?

232
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,240
见面只能尴尬来句...
I'm just sort of like...

233
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,330
你好
Hi.

234
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,280
我们毕业有三年了吧？
Is it three years since we graduated?

235
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,870
-四年了吧 -哦 都四年了吗
-Four, I think. -Oh, my God, is it four years?

236
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,690
是啊
Yeah.

237
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,210
时光飞逝啊
Time really does fly.

238
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,620
时光真飞逝啊
Time really does fly.

239
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,830
不过 对我和安尼丝大概不算
But not for me or Agnes probably,

240
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,950
我们还呆在学校里
since we're still here, still at the school.

241
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,520
你还呆在那房子里
You're still at your same house.

242
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,070
那破房子里
That little house.

243
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,550
就你们三个走出去的会觉得飞逝
But time probably flies for the three of you who left.

244
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,930
-去纽约啦 -嗯 对 纽约
-New York. -Yeah, yeah. New York.

245
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,420
哦
Wow.

246
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,690
替你高兴
Good for you.

247
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,330
嗯 回来这趟感触挺深
Um, but it's a trip being back.

248
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,440
去安尼丝家路上路过学校
I drove past the campus on my way to Agnes',

249
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,890
见到图书馆就起鸡皮疙瘩
and I just got, like, full body chills when I saw the library.

250
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,430
那图书馆 利迪 别提了
The library. Lydie, no. please.

251
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,830
你懂吧
You know what I mean?

252
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,160
那地方给我留着很深的压力印记
I have, like, deeply ingrained stress from that place.

253
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,290
对 读研时真太狠了
Yeah, Grad school was wild. I honestly feel like

254
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,170
我写那论文跟长征一样
I worked on that thesis for like, a decade.

255
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,620
可不是嘛 有次我在图书馆自习室
Yeah. This one time, um...on the third floor in a private room,

256
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,340
差点想用《小杜丽》那书
I almost paper cut my face open with my copy of Little Dorrit

257
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,370
{\an7}英国作家狄更斯刻画阶级与贫困的辛辣作品

258
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,810
把脸划破 好去医院里睡个安稳觉
just so I could go to the hospital and have a good night's sleep.

259
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,280
没真做 但闪过那念头
I didn't do it, but I thought about it.

260
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,050
嗯 有时我做噩梦
Yeah, sometimes I have nightmares

261
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,840
梦到我论文全变白纸 我还把它吃了
where my thesis is like all blank pages, and then I eat the pages.

262
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,530
天呐 那好可悲
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

263
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,880
是啊 可不是嘛 真的挺可悲的
Yeah. It is really sad, huh.

264
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,160
那么 安尼丝 你就过得很好了吗？
So, Agnes, it was really that easy for you?

265
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,440
不想谈谈什么经历吗？
No story? Nothing to share?

266
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,100
那事儿可不是安尼丝的错 是德克尔太粘她
Well, it's not Agnes' fault that Decker liked her best.

267
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,230
对 不是她的错 说来我都生气
No, it wasn't her fault,  but, um, it pissed me off.

268
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,160
这鱼做的不错 里面放了什么
This fish is amazing. What's... what's in it?

269
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,660
鱼啊
Fish.

270
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,670
你们俩近况如何？
Uh... well, how is it, you two?

271
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,380
都是老师了
You're the teachers now.

272
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,710
我还没有转正
I am still part time,

273
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,280
不过下学期会让我带一门课吧
but I think I'm gonna teach a class next semester...

274
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,350
还没正式说 但挺有戏
which they haven't said is what's gonna happen, but it could.

275
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,960
-是啊 挺有戏 -不 是一定会
-Yeah, it could. -No. It will.

276
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,420
对 对 一定会
Yeah. Yes. It, it will.

277
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,240
我们英语系这边还有新情况
Well, we have news in the English department.

278
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,580
安尼丝 该你的大新闻了
Agnes? Agnes has big news.

279
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,380
去下洗手间 抱歉
Bathroom. Sorry.

280
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,110
安尼丝已转正 占了威尔金森留的位置
Agnes is now a full-time teacher. She took Wilkinson's spot.

281
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,970
是接手了 那位置
Filled the spot.

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,210
安尼丝真厉害 这么年轻就转正了
Agnes is like super young to be full-time faculty.

283
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,070
对 五十年来最年轻的 靠腿上位的
Yeah, she's like the youngest in fifty years, that bitch.

284
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,270
开玩笑啦
I'm kidding.

285
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,380
没去干净
There's a bone.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,250
什么？
What?

287
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,330
鱼刺没去干净
In the fish.

288
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,850
{\an9}西餐通常会把鱼刺和骨头去除后上桌

289
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,320
你这鱼没剔干净 里面还有根鱼刺
There's, like, a bone in the fish that you served me.

290
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,170
抱歉
Sorry.

291
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
没事 没事
No, it's... it's fine.

292
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,380
下次你招待客人
It's just like maybe you should, like,

293
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,180
把鱼刺处理好 注意点礼数
debone it a little bit better before you serve it to people.

294
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,110
你好呀 我的猫宝贝
Hello, my baby.

295
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,160
我的猫宝贝
Oh, you're a baby.

296
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,010
妈妈爱你 妈妈爱你
I love you. I love you.

297
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,590
噢 要下去吗？
Oh, you wanna get down?

298
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,010
好 把你放下去
Okay. I'll put you down.

299
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,250
你会走出这房子吧？
You leave the house, right?

300
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,890
嗯 天天走出啊
Yeah. I leave the house.

301
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,540
得去上班 我有工作的 利迪
I go to work. I have a job, Lydie.

302
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,060
但...
But...

303
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,360
你还待在那间办公室里啊
you're still in the same office.

304
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,940
的确
Yes.

305
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,860
安尼丝 你说过你会换办公室的
Agnes, you said that you were gonna switch.

306
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,130
我 我可不想被迫解释换办公室的原因
Well, I...I didn't wanna have to explain why it's weird for me to be in that office.

307
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,350
你可以编个理由说墙发霉之类的
Maybe you should say there's mold or something.

308
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,300
也许吧
Maybe.

309
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,280
该死 要我打电话举报说墙板里有死动物发臭吗？
Do you want me to call them and say there's a dead animal in the wall?

310
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,400
你真是大好人 但不用
You are an angel from heaven, but no.

311
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,420
我刚转正
It's like, I just got the job.

312
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,700
我都不知道我配不配得上这位子
I don't even know if I should have the job.

313
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,140
安尼丝 别这样
Agnes.

314
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,180
我不想嫌我的办公室
I don't wanna complain about my office,

315
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,580
空间大 采光又好
which is technically huge, and there's a lot of light,

316
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,270
我能明白他为什么喜欢这间
and I can see why he liked it.

317
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,880
总之 是的 我决定走出去这房子
Anyways, yes, I leave the house.

318
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,980
安尼丝...
Agnes...

319
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,800
别...
don't...

320
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,960
去死

321
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,900
我不会死的
I'm not gonna die.

322
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,190
要真打算自尽
If I was gonna kill myself,

323
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,570
我早在去年做了
I would have done it like last year...

324
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,510
或者在前年
or the year before.

325
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,910
呃 肯定在前年
Ugh. Or, like, definitely the year before.

326
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,410
安尼丝 别
Agnes.

327
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,410
我不会死的
No. I'm not gonna die.

328
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,370
那我也回敬你一句
Let me return the sentiment.

329
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,900
你也别去死
You please don't die.

330
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,140
利迪...
Lydie...

331
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,420
你怀了个小宝宝
You're having a little baby.

332
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,510
我知道
I know.

333
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,590
你会把宝宝照顾得很好
You're gonna take such good care of your little baby.

334
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,550
我不会死的
I won't die.

335
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,480
求你别死
Please don't die.

336
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,440
不 我求你
No, you please don't die.

337
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,510
想跟宝宝打个招呼吗？
Do you wanna say hello?

338
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,270
嗨
Hi.

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,780
我是你妈妈
I'm your mommy.

341
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,130
利迪和弗兰可能会有别的说法 但听我说
Lydie and Fran may tell you otherwise, but heed my words.

342
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,490
-我是你妈 -安尼丝！
-I'm your mother. -Agnes!

343
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,860
-别闹 正经点 -好 好吧
-Do it properly. -Yeah. All right.

344
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,870
嗨 我是安尼丝
Hi. I'm Agnes.

345
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,170
我不是你妈妈
I'm not your mommy.

346
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,610
我就是你妈妈
I am your mommy.

347
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,030
哎 真受不了你
Oh, for goodness sake.

348
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,640
我觉得宝宝踢我了
I felt it kick.

349
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,700

352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,050
来
Hey.

353
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,310

I'll see you soon.

354
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,380

355
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,710

Come to New York.

356
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,110
我有空床
I've got an extra bed.

357
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,430
跟弗兰说因为我讨厌TA
Tell Fran that I hate them.

358
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,470
{\an9}TA为中性代词

359
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,330
才不
No.

360
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,710
好吧 其实不讨厌TA
No, I don't hate them.

361
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,990
我知道 宝贝
I know, babe.

362
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,040
-爱你 -也爱你
-Love you. -Love you.

363
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,210
哦 等下
Um, no.

364

快点回来哦
Come soon.

365
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,850
不是因为...
Not because of, like,

366
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,200
不是因为我要去死之类的 只是...
not because I'm gonna kill myself, but just...

367
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,720
只是...
Just...

368
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,540
别拖那么久才回来
don't wait so long to come back.

369
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,010
好的
Okay.

370
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,020

{\an8}那桩噩事的时光

374
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,290
他妈的！
Fuck!

375
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,710
他妈的！
Fuck!

376
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,750
怎么了？
What is happening?

377
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,840
—发生什么事了？—天啊！
-What's happening? -Oh, my God!

378
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,630
我讨厌学校！
I hate school!

379
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,670
学校真他妈烂！
School fucking sucks!

380
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,510
我的大脑感觉像着火了一样
My brain feels like it's on fire.

381
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,050
就像我快要死了一样！
Like I'm gonna fucking die!

382
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,470
我刚刚意识到 宝贝
I just realized, babe,

383
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,390
没人关心泰德·休斯
no one gives a fuck about Ted Hughes.

384
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,060
不 每个人都关心泰德休斯
No, everyone cares about Ted Hughes.

385
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,600
不不不 我简直不敢相信
No, no, no. I can't believe this.

386
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,940
我花了两年时间写一个人
I spent two years writing about a guy.

387
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,770
我甚至不再睁着眼睛和男人做爱了
I don't even fuck guys with my eyes open anymore.

388
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,610
我只是闭上眼睛想象着女人
I just close my eyes and imagine women.

389
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,780
你想谈论这个吗？
Do you wanna talk about that?

390
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,370
关于什么？
About what?

391
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,200
没有什么
Nothing.

392
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,010
好的 我来了 抱歉 我来了
Okay, I'm here. Sorry, I'm here.

393
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,220
我们做到了吗？
Did we do it?

394
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
仅仅
Barely.

395
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,770
—德文？—是的 我做到了
-Devin? -Yes, I did.

396
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,860
真的很抱歉 我其实不拖延
I am so sorry. I don't really procrastinate,

397
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,190
所以这对我来说不算什么
so this wasn't like a whole thing for me.

398
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,860
没关系
That's okay.

399
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,610
继续炫耀吧 它会让你获得成功
Keep showing off, it'll get you places.

400
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,910
莉迪亚
Lydie.

401
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,790
我是莉迪亚
I'm Lydie.

402
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,910
你做完了嗎？
Did you finish?

403
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,330
嗯 是的 嗯...
Uh, yeah, um...

404
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,170
是的 但问题是
Yeah, but the thing is,

405
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,590
别生气 我已经看完了
like, don't be mad. I did finish it.

406
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,920
最后一页就像是复制粘贴的摘录......
The last page is, like, a copy and paste extract of...

407
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,090
《向伯利恒跋涉》不是我写的
"Slouching Towards Bethlehem" that I didn't write.

408
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,310
—耶茨还是迪迪恩？—迪迪恩
-Yates or Didion? -Didion.

409
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,770
永远是迪迪恩
Always Didion.

410
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,190
呃...嘿 你知道吗？
Uh... Hey, you know what?

411
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,190
我应该是你的导师、助手 或者其他什么的
I'm supposed to be your mentor, helper, whatever.

412
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,900
我来这里只是为了确保这件事能够发生
I'm just here to make sure it happens.

413
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,030
我做了我的
I did mine.

414
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,070
好的 很好 那……太好了 娜塔莎
Okay. Good. That's... that's great, Natasha.

415
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,240

Lydie, you think you can finish by Wednesday?

416
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,370
到时候把没有琼的草稿给我吧？
Get me your draft minus the Joan by then?

417
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,040
是啊 又一次……
Yeah, again...

418
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,080
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

419
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,540
你会读我的书吗？
Are you gonna read mine?

420
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,380
当然 这是我的工作
Of course. That's my job.

421
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,340
你要问艾格尼丝她是否做了这件事吗？
Are you gonna ask Agnes if she did hers?

422
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,380
是的
Yeah.

423
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,050
艾格尼丝……
Agnes...

424
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,180
你的情况怎么样？
How'd yours go?

425
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,180
好的 我做到了
Fine. I did it.

426
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,430
迫不及待想读
Can't wait to read.

427
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,280
但你也会读我的 对吧？
But you're gonna read mine too though, right?

428
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,060
是的
Yes.

429
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,620
我为什么还在做这件事？
Why am I still working on this?

430
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,250
因为你还没完成它
Because you didn't finish it.

431
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,370
无意冒犯
No offense.

432
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,380
别吹牛了
Stop bragging.

433
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,500
我不是在吹牛
I'm not bragging.

434
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,590
你的腿靠在墙上
Your legs are on the wall.

435
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,920
所以？
So?

436
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,300
好吧 如果我完成了它
Well, if I'd finished it,

437
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,300
我的腿也会靠在墙上
my legs would be on the wall too,

438
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,300
但我没有
but I haven't.

439
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,140
所以 我的腿不在墙上
So, my legs aren't on the wall.

440
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,720
好的 我会把它们拿下来
Okay. I will take them down.

441
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,450
什么？
What?

442
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,410
你应该操他
You should fuck him.

443
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,290
我不想和他做爱
I don't wanna fuck him.

444
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,790
—真的吗？—是的
-Really? -Yes.

445
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,960
好吧 如果你不想和他上床
Well, if you don't wanna fuck him,

446
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,170
绝对不要和他发生性关系
definitely don't fuck him.

447
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,300
我不会
I won't.

448
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,220
我觉得他想和你做爱
I think he wants to fuck you.

449
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,220
—真的吗？—是的
-Really? -Yeah.

450
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,350
—嗯 真糟糕 —为什么？
-Well, that sucks. -Why?

451
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,810
你认为这就是他说我聪明的原因吗？
Do you think that's why he's telling me I'm smart?

452
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,350
不 我觉得他在告诉你你很聪明
No, I think he's telling you you're smart

453
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,810
因为你真的很聪明
because you're really smart.

454
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,820
好的
Okay.

455
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,700
但你会说什么呢……
What would you say though...

456
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,280
如果他要求你和他做爱？
if he asked you to fuck him?

457
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,030
我会说不
I would say no.

458
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,790
如果他问起的话我会很不高兴
I would be upset if he asked.

459
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,660
我明白
I get that.

460
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,420
我明白
I get that.

461
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,590
我会说不...
I would say no...

462
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,800
但谢谢你
but thank you.

463
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,600
进来吧
Come on in.

464
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,100
你好
Hi.

465
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,100
艾格尼丝 你好
Agnes, hi.

466
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,440
感谢您与我会面
Thanks for meeting with me.

467
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,940
你在忙些什么吗？
Are you working on something?

468
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,070
我是说...
I mean...

469
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,860
不 不 不……
No. Not, not...

470
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,950
并不真地
not really.

471
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,700
好吧 现在你必须告诉我
Well, now you have to tell me.

472
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,040
为什么？
Why?

473
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
因为现在我知道的太多了
Because now I know too much.

474
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,090
嗯 好的 嗯……
Uh, yeah, okay. Um...

475
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,880
我正在写一本书
I'm writing a book.

476
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,550
—一本书？—一本书
-A book? -A book.

477
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,680
一本很长的书？
A long book?

478
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,550
-中等 -良好
-Medium. -Good.

479
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,100
为什么？
Why?

480
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,520
嗯 长就像...好的 我们明白了
Well, long is like... okay, we get it.

481
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,690
对 短的就像……
Right. And short is like...

482
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,390
你为什么要写这本书？
Why did you even write a book?

483
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,400
是啊 虽然这是中等的……
Yeah, well, even though this is medium...

484
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,940
—长度刚刚好 —是的
-The perfect length. -Yeah.

485
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,740
我不得不说这太可怕了
I have to say it is horrible,

486
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,160
每次看到它 我就想自杀
and every time I look at it, I wanna kill myself.

487
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,280
毫米
Mm.

488
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,700
嗯 确实有这样的书
Well, there actually have to be books like that

489
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,790
这样我们就可以区分
so that we can distinguish

490
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,580
哪些书才是真正的好书
which books are really the good books.

491
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,540
是的
Yes.

492
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,210
我写这本烂书是为了做公益
I'm doing a public service by writing a shit book.

493
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,630
出色地
Well,

494
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,340
如果有帮助的话
if it helps at all,

495
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,100
我喜欢你的第一部小说
I liked your first novel.

496
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,930
我喜欢它有多糟糕并且......
I liked how fucked up it was and...

497
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,140
这让我觉得这是有原因的
how it made me feel like there's a reason,

498
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,230
即使我看不到 我也知道我还活着
even if I can't see it, that I'm alive.

499
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,100
这并不像小说
And it didn't feel like fiction,

500
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,480
我认为在这种情况下这是一种赞美
which I think is a compliment in this case.

501
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,770
和...
And...

502
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,740
我在做其他事情的时候也一直在想这件事
I think about it all the time when I'm doing other stuff,

503
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,700
就像吃冰淇淋一样
like eating ice cream

504
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,160
或者看着窗外
or looking out the window.

505
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,160
谢谢
Thank you.

506
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,790
谢谢
Thank you.

507
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,380
好的 呃...
Okay, uh...

508
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,880
一...
Um...

509
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,970
关于我的事就说到这里吧
Enough about me.

510
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,390
我读了你的论文
I read your thesis.

511
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,930
你读得真快
You read it really fast.

512
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,180
是啊 嗯 我 呃...
Yeah, well, I, uh...

513
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,560
说实话 我实在无法放下它
to be honest, I couldn't put it down.

514
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,690
有人把你的手粘在上面吗？
Someone glue your hands to it?

515
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,190
什么？
What?

516
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,900
—哦...—对不起
-Oh... -I'm sorry.

517
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,440
基本上没有任何意义
Makes basically no sense.

518
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,280
不 确实如此
No, it does.

519
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,610
一...
Um...

520
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,650
是的
Yeah.

521
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,910
— 无论如何 所以 呃... — 是啊
-Anyway, so, uh... -Yeah.

522
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,700
整个部分
This whole section

523
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,950
从第三页到第七页
from page three through seven,

524
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,290
我发现这绝对公正……
I find to be absolutely just...

525
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,750
非凡的
extraordinary.

526
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,000
真的
Really.

527
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,050
对不起
Sorry.

528

534

你应该引起我的全部注意
You should have my full attention,

536
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,660
坦白说 这篇论文值得得到这样的评价
and frankly, this paper deserves that.

537
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,030
—我们可以稍后再安排 —好的 没问题

-Oh, that's okay. -Oh, actually,

542
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,590
你应该看看这个

543
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,590

好的
All right.

550

我们被要求考虑这个想法
We are asked to reckon with the idea

551
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,810
夺走他的生命
that taking his life,

552
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,560
逃离物质存在
taking flight from the corporeal existence,

553
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,980
也许是给 Milkman 的
is perhaps for Milkman

554
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,700
这是一场超越 而非悲剧
a transcendence and not a tragedy.

555
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,780
米尔克曼感觉自己正在回到祖籍地

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,730
—抱歉 —别抱歉
-Sorry. -Don't be sorry.

569
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,110
你有我的论文吗？
Do you have my thesis?

570
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,110
哦 是的 是的 是的 是的
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,030
你的鞋带松了
Your shoes are untied.

572
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,650
哦
Ooh.

573
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,400
嘿 我真是一直在屏息等待
Hey, I've been literally waiting with bated breath.

574
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,570
进展如何？
How did it go?

575
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,120
艾格尼丝 你还好吗？
Agnes, are you okay?

576
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,040
发生了什么？
What happened?

577
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,710
我不知道
I don't know.

578
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,170
我的裤子破了
My pants are broken.

579
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,060
然后我们开始接吻
And then we started kissing.

580
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,150
我以为我们在接吻
And I thought, we're kissing.

581
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,320
我以为我们一直在接吻
I was thinking we were kissing the whole time,

582
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,530
就像以一种不好的方式
like in a bad way

583
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,200
当你过得不开心的时候
where you aren't having a good time,

584
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,160
就像某人的嘴一样
and it's just like someone's mouth.

585
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,450
然后我说
And then I said,

586
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,500
“我真的不认为我准备好接吻了
"I don't really think I'm ready to be kissing.

587
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,160
我刚刚摆脱了一件事 ”
I just got out of a thing."

588
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,960
这是我编造的
Which is something I made up.

589
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,540
对此撒谎是可以的
It's okay to lie about that.

590
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,670
然后他说 “没关系 ”
And then he said, "That's okay."

591
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,590
“我们可以坐在沙发上看电影 ”
"We can just sit on the couch and watch a movie."

592
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,220
于是他开始玩一些东西
So he started playing something.

593
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,310
它是动画的 我认为这很奇怪
It was animated, which I thought was weird.

594
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,520
但后来我想起他有个孩子
But then I remembered he has a kid,

595
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,940
这样就没那么奇怪了
so that made it less weird.

596
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,400
然后他开始把手放在我的裤子上
Then he started putting his hand on my pants,

597
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,490
我正把它移开
and I was kinda moving it away.

598
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,660
但他一直把它移回我的裤子里
But he kept moving it back to my pants,

599
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,080
然后他开始把手伸进我的裤子里 就像
and then he started putting his hand down my pants, like,

600
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,210
在裤子和内衣之间
in between the pants and my underwear.

601
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,710
我的身体扭动得像……
And I was kinda squirming my body like...

602
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,550
他是……
he was...

603
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,220
他的手指非常有力且坚硬
his fingers were really strong and hard,

604
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,550
就像 以不好的方式
like, in the bad way.

605
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,760
就像 这太难了
Like, it was too hard.

606
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,690
也许感觉会很好
Maybe it would've felt good

607
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,190
如果我希望他的手指能做到这一点
if I wanted his fingers to be doing that.

608
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,400
但你并不想要那样
But you didn't want that.

609
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,610
不 我没有
No, I didn't.

610
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,070
然后 我把他的手拉了出来 因为……
And then, I pulled his hand out because...

611
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,160
感觉不太好
it didn't feel good,

612
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,660
而且确实有点疼
and it actually hurt, kinda.

613
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,710
然后我开始亲吻他
And then I started kissing him

614
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,000
因为我认为
because I thought,

615
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,880
“好吧 如果我们必须做点什么的话 ”
"Well, if we have to be doing something,"

616
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,840
“我宁愿亲吻 也不愿他的手指伸进去 ”
"I'd rather it be kissing than his fingers down there."

617
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,220
然后我就不记得了
And then I don't remember.

618
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,860
然后在某个时刻
And then at some point,

619
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,860
他的手又伸进了我的内裤
his hand was back in my underwear.

620
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,190
但现在在内衣下面
But under the underwear now.

621
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,490
我又试图把它移开
And I was trying to move it away again.

622
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,700
听起来你曾多次试图将它移开
Sounds like you were trying to move it away a lot.

623
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,370
是的 我一直这么想
Yeah. That's what I kept thinking.

624
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,830
就像 再来一次 他就不会再把它移回去
Like, one more time and he won't move it back

625
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,790
因为它太明显了 所以我把它移开了
because it's so obvious I'm moving it away.

626
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,960
但他一直将其移回
But he kept moving it back.

627
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,920
进而...
And then...

628
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,140
他正在拉下我的裤子……
he was pulling down my pants...

629
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,850
嗯 他试图把它们拉下来
Well, he was trying to pull them down,

630
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,220
但它们有一个按钮
but they have a button.

631
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,390
所以他一直拉啊拉
So he was pulling, pulling.

632
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,850
我把它们拉了回来
And I was pulling them back up.

633
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,860
然后他们就走到了半山腰
And then they were halfway down.

634
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,030
我感觉有什么东西进入了我的体内
And I felt something go in, like, in me,

635
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,620
我的脊椎开始发凉
and my spine got cold.

636
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,330
我伸手去摸它 然后……
And I reached down to feel it and...

637
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,250
这是……
It was...

638
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,130
就是他……你知道吗？
It was him... you know?

639
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,430
然后我跳了起来......
And then I jumped up and...

640
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,840
我坐在沙发边上
I sat on the side of the couch.

641
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,850
我不知道要多久
I don't know how long.

642
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,440
我看了一眼他的脸
And I looked at his face once,

643
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,650
它看起来好像很害怕
and it was, like, scared.

644
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,690
—他的脸上露出了害怕的表情？—是的
-His face was scared? -Yes.

645
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,740
然后我就慢慢地站了起来
And then I just got up kinda slowly,

646
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,410
我抓起靴子
and I grabbed my boots,

647
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,290
然后我开车回家
and I drove home,

648
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,090
现在我在这里
and now I'm here.

649
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,430
听起来像...
That sounds like...

650
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,100
那
that.

651
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,190
那是...
That is...

652
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,780
就是这样
that's the thing.

653
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,410
我真的非常非常抱歉
I'm really, really sorry.

654
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,030
我不知道我是否应该完全赤裸
I never know if I'm supposed to get fully naked.

655
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,700
—就像穿着长袍一样？—是的
-Like in the gown? -Yeah.

656
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,870
—你现在裸体吗？—是的
-Are you naked right now? -Yes.

657
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
兄弟 我认为你不应该裸体
Dude, I don't think you're supposed to be naked.

658
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,790
你好 你是艾格尼丝吗？
Hi. You're Agnes?

659
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,880
—是的 你好 —我是埃文斯医生
-Yeah, hi. -I'm doctor Evans.

660
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,430
你被性侵了吗？
You were sexually assaulted?

661
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,550
嗯 是的
Uh, yeah.

662
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,800
你现在觉得安全吗？
Do you feel safe now?

663
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,680
抱歉 在我们这样做之前
Sorry, before... uh, we do that,

664
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,530
我只是想让你知道我全身赤裸
I just want you to know that I'm fully naked.

665
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,230
-什么？-在长袍下面 可以吗？
-What? -Under the robe. Is that okay?

666
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,440
嗯 没问题
Yeah. That's fine.

667
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,530
—你介意吗？—当然可以
-Do you mind? -Yeah, sure.

668
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,280
那么 这是什么时候发生的？
So, when did this happen?

669
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,490
那件事？
The thing?

670
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,040
—袭击 —昨晚
-The assault. -Last night.

671
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,240
昨天晚上
Last evening.

672
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,750
昨天晚上
Yesterday evening.

673
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,330
—你洗澡了吗？—我洗了个澡
-And have you showered? -I took a bath.

674
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,080
所以最好去急诊室
So it's usually best to go to the emergency room

675
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,920
就在这样的事情发生之后
right after something like this happens.

676
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,710
哦好的
Oh, okay.

677
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,510
下次我一定会记住这一点
I will definitely keep that in mind for the next time.

678
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,590
嗯 这时候我们会用
Well, that's when we would use

679
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,180
性侵犯法医证据工具包
a sexual assault forensic evidence kit.

680
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,050
哦 好的 我觉得你只需要……
Oh, okay. I feel like you just need to...

681
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,390
音调上偏离了音调
tonally shift away from the tone

682
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,310
你现在正在服用
you're taking right now.

683
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,060
就像 我们只是需要音调的转变
Like, we just need a tonal shift.

684
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,180
只是想确认他没有给我任何东西
Just wanna make sure he didn't give me anything,

685
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,980
比如 阴道或者
like, vaginally or yeah.

686
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,570
袭击者在你体内射精了吗？
Did your attacker ejaculate in you?

687
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,360
嗯 我不会称他为袭击我的人
Um, well, I wouldn't call him my attacker.

688
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,280
这不像是 呸！
It wasn't like, bah!

689
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,450
但你被强奸了
But you were raped.

690
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,570
—哇哦 —是的
-Whoa. -Yeah.

691
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,740
说得好
And well put.

692
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,620
我知道这很难说
I know this is hard to talk about.

693
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,410
感觉你不知道这一点
It doesn't feel that you know that.

694
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,790
这些问题是礼仪问题
These questions are protocol.

695
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,130
是的 你问他们的方式真的很怪异
Yeah, you're asking them in a really freaky way.

696
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,460
冷静一下 女士
Calm down, ma'am.

697
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,880
—哦 她很冷静 —我很冷静
-Oh, she's calm. -I'm calm.

698
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,300
你可以继续提问了
You can finish your questions.

699
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,590
他射精到你体内了吗？
Did he ejaculate in you?

700
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,260
可怕的词
Horrible word.

701
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,430
不 他实际上在我体内
No, the actual him being inside me part

702
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,140
没过多久 就像……
wasn't that long, it was like...

703
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,100
—那么久 —好的
-that long. -Okay.

704
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,150
所以 我们会进行血液检查 检查你是否怀孕
So, we'll do a blood test to check you for pregnancy

705
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,230
以及性传播感染
and sexually transmitted infections,

706
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,070
然后我们会进行宫颈培养
and then we'll do a cervix culture.

707
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,070
-嗯 -什么事？
-Yum. -Excuse me?

708
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,110
她说好吃

712
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,720

713
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,680
德克尔正在转学

714
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
他在纽约北部找到了一份工作

他要走了

716
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,060
他妈的

717
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,230
搞什么鬼？

00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,780
不
No.

720
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,780
也许吧 我不知道

721
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,620
他对此有何评论？
Did he say anything about this?

722
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,910
不
No.

723
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,290
昨天他的办公桌非常乱
And yesterday his desk was, like, really cluttered.

724
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,380
就像他没有打包任何东西一样
Like he wasn't packed or anything.

725
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,680
所以他正在跑步
So he's running.

726
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,100
他妈的
Fuck.

00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,210
—嗨 我是...—艾格尼丝

730
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,710
你介意跟我们一起回去吗？
Do you mind coming back with us?

731
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,840
当然

732
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,560
得知您遭遇此事 我们深感抱歉
We are so sorry to hear this happened to you.

733
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,060
我们正在采取这一行动
We are taking this

734
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,480
真的很认真

735
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,700
你会做什么吗？
Are you gonna do anything?

736
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,660
我们将开始调查
We would begin an investigation.

737
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,030
但正如你可能听说的那样
But as you may have heard,

738
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,790
他昨天在……递交了辞职信

00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,750
下午 4:18

00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,000
您于今天上午 8:42 报告了此事
And you reported this today at 8:42 am.

741
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,420
好的
Okay.

742
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,880
不幸的是 他不再受雇于我们了
Unfortunately, he's no longer under our employ.

743
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,890
因此我们不能采取通常采取的措施
So we can't take the measures that we would normally take

744
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,930
比如暂停他或者解雇他或者……
such as suspending him or letting him go or...

745
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,310
类似这样的事情

746
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,480
这些事情真的很难
These things are really hard,

747
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,570
不幸的是 大学无法
and the University is unfortunately unable

748
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,820
承担任何责任
to take any kind of responsibility.

749
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,650
但他是我的顾问

750
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,370
前任顾问
Former advisor.

751
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,410
您可以选择
You have the option

752
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,960
去警察局报案
of going to the police station and reporting this

753
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,210
并发出逮捕令
and issuing an arrest warrant.

754
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,340
我们知道你正在经历什么

对不起 我只是想把自己封闭起来

811
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,870

822
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,700
如果你需要有人烧毁他的办公室

823
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,450
但你不想自己做

830
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,970

831
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,100
比如他的头发或者他的笔或者别的什么

我告诉邻居 这简直就是一个弥天大谎
I told the neighbor, it's like this whole big lie.

837
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,490
我陷入了谎言之中
I'm stuck in a lie.

838
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,820
好的 我会做的
Okay. I will do it.

839
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:06,620
—对不起 —不 没关系
-I'm sorry. -No, it's fine.

840
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,870
我本来要去杀一个人 所以这容易多了
I was gonna, like, kill a man, so this is much easier.

841
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,620
我们有热狗吗？

846
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,560
好吧 操
Well, fuck.

847
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,230
这真是太好了
This is really nice.

848
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,530

849
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,530

00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,550
你在撒谎
You're lying.

对于那些还没有这样做的人
For those of you who haven't done this

874
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,400
不知道会发生什么
and don't know what to expect,

875
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:19,530
请上来

富勒夫人 您觉得呢？
And do you think, Mrs. Fuller,

892
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,350
根据该定义
based on that definition,

893
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,980
你明白“排除合理怀疑”的意思吗？
you understand the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt?

894
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:35,650
是的
Yes.

895
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,440
毫无疑问地确信
That to be convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt,

896
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,490
你一定去过那里
you must have been there

897
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,150
并亲眼目睹了犯罪行为？
and seen the crime with your own eyes?

898
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,860
是的 我明白
Yes. I understand.

899
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,240
你们其他人是否觉得
And do the rest of you feel

900
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,080
你可以应用这个想法 毫无疑问
you can apply that idea, beyond a reasonable doubt,

901
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,450
—对于这个案子？—嗯
-to this case? -Mhmm.

902
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,100
你们当中有多少人有孩子？
How many of you have children?

903
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,290
呃 沃加德先生
Uh, Mr. Woguard.

904
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,420
你有孩子吗？
You have a child?

905
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,250
嗯 是的 索菲刚满四岁
Uh, yes. Soph just turned four.

906
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,170
假设你和你的女儿在公园
Say you and your daughter were at the park

907
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,550
她正在玩攀爬架
and she's playing on the monkey bars.

908
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,470
你转过身去几分钟
And you turned your back for a few minutes,

909
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,800
然后她就带着断掉的手臂跑向你
and then she runs over to you with a broken arm.

910
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,970
您认为会发生什么？
What would you think happened?

911
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,310
她从攀爬架上摔了下来
She fell off the monkey bars

912
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,270
并打断了她的手臂
and broke her arm.

913
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,730
是的 这是一个例子
Yes, so that's an example

914
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,640
间接证据
of circumstantial evidence.

915
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,230
这就是你可以合理推断的
That's what you can reasonably infer

916
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,360
根据你所掌握的事实
based on the facts that you have.

917
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,020
这有道理吗 沃加德先生？
Does this make sense, Mr. Woguard?

918
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,650
是的
Yes.

919
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,280
如果另一个孩子跑向你
And if instead another child ran over to you

920
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,870
并告诉你他看到她从攀爬架上摔下来
and told you he saw her fall off the monkey bars,

921
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,450
这是直接的证词
that's direct testimony

922
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,740
因为有人目睹了这一切
because someone witnessed it.

923
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,160
大家明白这个区别吗？
Does everybody understand that difference,

924
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,210
间接证据之间
between circumstantial evidence

925
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,710
和直接证词？
and direct testimony?

926
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,130
嗯
Mhmm.

927
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,590
在没有直接证词的情况下
Without direct testimony,

928
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,630
我们不能肯定
we cannot be positively certain

929
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,420
犯罪已经发生
a crime has been committed.

930
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,930
正如检方所说
As the prosecution,

931
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,800
我必须证明被告有罪
I must prove the defendant's guilt

932
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,550
毫无合理怀疑
beyond a reasonable doubt.

933
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,930
意思是 没有其他合理的解释
Meaning, that there is no other reasonable explanation

934
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,140
这可以从所提供的证据中得出
that can come from evidence presented.

935
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,600
如果你们当中有人成为犯罪的受害者
If any of you have been victims of a crime,

936
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,150
请举手
please raise your hand.

937
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,280
呃 费伯先生 犯罪内容是什么？
Uh, Mr. Faber, what was the crime?

938
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,450
呃 我被抢劫了 被枪指着
Uh, I was robbed. At gunpoint.

939
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,780
你有什么理由相信
Do you have any reason to believe

940
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,530
这段经历会让你无法服务
that experience would make you unable to serve

941
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:07,910
作为本次审判的公正陪审员？
as an impartial juror on this trial?

942
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,160
不
No.

943
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,250
沃德小姐
Miss Ward.

944
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,540
什么？
What?

945
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,580
当我问谁是犯罪的受害者时
When I asked who has been a victim of a crime,

946
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,590
你举手了吗？
did you raise your hand?

947
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,170
不 我意识到我不应该分享它
No, I realized I shouldn't share it.

948
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,710
所以...
So...

949
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,800
你不能分担罪行吗？
You're unable to share the crime?

950
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,300
一...
Um...

951
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,100
坦白说这是我最可怕的噩梦
It is frankly my worst nightmare

952
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,640
必须告诉整个房间的陌生人
to have to tell this whole room of strangers

953
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,180
关于发生在我身上的事
about the thing that happened to me.

954
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:33,980
所以...
So...

955
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,560
这就是我没有决定的原因
that is the reasoning as to why I did not decide

956
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,730
继续举手
to continue having my hand raised.

957
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,820
谢谢
Thank you.

958
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,570
你认为该罪行会导致你无法服役
Do you think the crime would make you unable to serve

959
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:48,070
作为此案的公正陪审员？
as an impartial juror on this case?

960
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,530
这是个好问题
That is a good question,

961
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,490
这也是我一直在思考的问题
and one I've been thinking about.

962
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,620
你得出什么结论了吗？
Have you come to any conclusions?

963
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,210
你知道 我想我会更好
You know, I think I would be better

964
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,670
不在陪审团中
not being on the jury

965
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:00,710
反而会做得更好
and instead would do better

966
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,800
履行不同的公民角色
fulfilling a different civic role.

967
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,090
您心目中的公民角色是什么样的？
And what kind of civic role do you have in mind?

968
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:07,590
所以 谢谢你的提问
So, thank you for asking.

969
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,760
我其实是一名教授
I am actually a professor,

970
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:13,810
兼职 希望很快能成为全职
part-time, hopefully soon full-time,

971
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,770
其中 教学是重要的工作
which, teaching is important work.

972
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:18,060
我认为教学很重要
I think teaching is important.

973
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:21,770
有人会说老师是理想的陪审员
Some would say that a teacher makes an ideal juror.

974
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,570
绝对不是 不是
Absolutely not, no.

975
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,280
在您的问卷上 您写道……
On your questionnaire, you wrote...

976
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,570
哦 不 不
Oh, no, no.

977
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,320
我不知道我们会大声朗读这些 所以
I did not know that we would be reading those aloud, so.

978
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,240
“你的朋友会如何形容你？”
"How would your friends describe you?"

979
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,200
“聪明的 ”
"Smart."

980
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:35,160
划掉“tall”这个词
Crossed out, then the word "tall."

981
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,210
如果你所遭受的犯罪行为使你产生偏见
If the crime you were a victim of makes you biased,

982
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,380
我们将解雇你
we will dismiss you.

983
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,670
我告诉你这件事会惹上麻烦吗？
Can I get in trouble for telling you?

984
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,090
如果你是受害者 为什么你会遇到麻烦？
Why would you get in trouble if you were the victim?

985
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,340
我不知道
I don't know.

986
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,850
我认为这项法律毫无意义
The law makes no sense in my opinion.

987
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,520
我...
I...

988
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,070
事实上我之前没有大声说过
I haven't said it out loud actually before.

989
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,280
嗯 没关系
Well, that's okay.

990
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,240
你去报警了吗？
Did you go to the police?

991
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:11,620
不
No.

992
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,990
我只有一个按钮
All I had was a button,

993
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,790
我不想让他进监狱
and I don't want him to go to jail.

994
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,500
这是为什么？
Why is that?

995
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,000
他有一个孩子
He has a kid.

996

演示本身
the presentation itself,

1114
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,740
以及演讲的内容？

01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:30,820
但是 是因为其他原因 而不是因为这个
But, for other reasons, not because of this.

1137
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,240
好的 嗯...
Okay, well, um...

1138
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,580
只是因为事情对你来说很容易
just because things come easy to you

1139
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,160
并不意味着你可以从别人那里拿走东西
doesn't mean that you get to take things from people

1140
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,540
事情来之不易
who things don't come easy to.

1141
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,750
对我来说事情并不容易
Things don't come easy to me.

1142
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,000
是的 大家都喜欢你
Yes they do. Everyone likes you.

1143
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,790
—你很聪明 你很性感 —谢谢你
-You're smart, you're hot. -Thank you.

1144
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,040
呃 不是那样的
Ew, not like that.

1145
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,800
洛根喜欢你 德文也喜欢你
Logan likes you, Devin likes you.

1146
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,000
Lydie 喜欢你
Lydie likes you.

1147
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,630
德克尔喜欢你
Decker likes you.

1148
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,720
嗯 你不喜欢我
Well, you don't like me.

1149
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,100
这是真的
That's true.

1150
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,690
这是真的
That's true.

1151
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:13,410
你知道 当我想到这一点时
You know, when I think about it,

1152
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,990
我认为德克尔实际上恨我
I think Decker actually hated me.

1153
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,750
你是他选中的人
You were his chosen one.

1154
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,250
这真是太疯狂了
That's a completely insane thing to say.

1155
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,210
不
No.

1156
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,170
因为当你喜欢某人或者
Because when you like someone or, like,

1157
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:25,960
当你尊重某人时
when you respect someone,

1158
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:30,300
人们对待你的方式有些不同
there are some ways people treat you

1159
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,260
这是一种方法
that are one way.

1160
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,220
尊重 并且喜欢
Respectful, and like,

1161
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,680
你是一个活着、呼吸着的人
you're a person who lives and breathes

1162
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,390
并独立思考
and thinks for them self.

1163
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:45,060
但有些人对待你的方式却不是那样的
And then some ways people treat you are not that way,

1164
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,310
而且它们很糟糕
and they're bad.

1165
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,450
好吧 嗯 我和他上床了……
All right. Well, um, I fucked him...

1166
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,160
他甚至没有花时间
and, uh, he didn't even take the time

1167
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,950
亲自给我论文做笔记 所以……
to give me in-person notes on my thesis. So...

1168
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,080
你跟他上床了？
You fucked him?

1169
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:03,750
是的
Yeah.

1170
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,090
你想要那个吗？
Did you want that?

1171
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,380
想要啥？
Want what?

1172
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,800
是故意的吗？
Was it on purpose?

1173
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,220
是的 这是故意的
Yes, it was on purpose.

1174
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,560
我们进行了大约五分钟的性爱
We had, like, five minute sex.

1175
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,390
还行吧 我吃过更好的了
It was just okay. I've had better.

1176
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,840
我们关门了 这里不能停车
We're closed. You can't park here.

1177
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,100
哦 糟糕 哦 糟糕
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1178
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,480
听着 我很抱歉对你大喊大叫
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1179
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,150
我的孩子汉克也会出现呼吸困难的情况
My kid, Hank, gets these breathing attacks too,

1180
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:09,400
有时真的很糟糕
real bad sometimes.

1181
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:12,230
我知道你很害怕
I know you're scared,

1182
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,530
但你已经离开了道路 坐在车里
but you're off the road, you're in your car,

1183
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:16,530
你没事
and you're okay.

1184
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,370
我要呼吸 你也和我一起呼吸
I'm gonna breathe and you breathe with me.

1185
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,830
好吗？你跟着就行
Okay? You just follow.

1186
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:22,410
好吗？准备好了吗？在……
All right? You ready? In...

1187
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,960
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1188
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,380
在...
In...

1189
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,710
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1190
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,840
在...
In...

1191
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:41,300
出局……二、三、四、五
Out... two, three, four, five.

1192
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,600
在...二、三
In... two, three.

1193
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,520
出去...
Out...

1194
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,730
二、三、四、五
Two, three, four, five.

1195
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,690
我必须说实话
I gotta be honest,

1196
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:52,860
我不太会这样呼吸
I don't really breathe like that,

1197
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,070
但感觉很好
but it feels good.

1198
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:56,190
你还好吗？
You doing okay?

1199
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,070
对你有好处
Good for you.

1200
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,030
你想要一个三明治吗？
You want a sandwich?

1201
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,840
我想在这里摆放桌子
I wanted to put tables out here

1202
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,960
所以 你知道 人们不会坐在地上
so, people, you know, wouldn't sit on the ground.

1203
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,510
这是一个美味的三明治
It's a good sandwich.

1204
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:19,800
你不应该吃一个好三明治
You shouldn't eat a good sandwich

1205
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,970
当你坐在地上时
while you're sitting on the ground

1206
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,140
鸽子拉屎的地方
where the pigeons shit.

1207
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,760
任何
Whatever.

1208
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,890
但他们说 你们共享一个……
But they said, you share a...

1209
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,730
垃圾场里有停车场
a parking lot with the guys at the dump.

1210
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,640
所以你得问问垃圾场的人
So you gotta ask the guys at the dump.

1211
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:32,650
我才不会问垃圾场里的人呢！
No fucking way I'm asking the guys at the dump!

1212
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,980
他妈的混蛋
Fucking assholes.

1213
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:40,240
这很好
This is good.

1214
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,740
是的 当然好
Yeah, of course it's good.

1215
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,370
你没有三明治店
You don't have a sandwich shop,

1216
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,790
你做的三明治不太好
you don't make a good sandwich.

1217
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,500
辛辣的
Spicy.

1218
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,830
卡拉布里亚辣椒 非常昂贵
Calabrian chili, very expensive.

1219
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,420
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

1220
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,380
咦？
Huh?

1221
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,050
—艾格尼丝？—是的
-Agnes? -Yeah.

1222
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,680
-呃 -哇哦
-Ugh. -Whoa,

1223
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,640
你们听起来就像垃圾堆里来的坏人
you sound like the mean guys from the dump.

1224
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,350
嘿！我……我对此感到不满
Hey! I res... I resent that.

1225
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:10,230
那些家伙都是混蛋 说实话 我不是混蛋
Those guys are assholes. I'm honest, not an asshole.

1226
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,110
你有个儿子？
You have a son?

1227
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,980
他是个混蛋
He's an asshole.

1228
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,360
汉克
Hank.

1229
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,990
—汉克是……—呃……
-Hank is... -Ugh...

1230
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,910
你不必告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

1231
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,950
听起来太像“honk”这个词了
Sounds too much like the word honk.

1232
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,160
—你有孩子吗？—没有
-You have kids? -No.

1233
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,670
想要一些吗？
Want some?

1234
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,090
呃……好吧 我真的无法想象自己变老
Uh... Well, I can't really imagine myself old.

1235
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,420
你以为我想象中的自己是这样的吗？
You think I imagined myself like this?

1236
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,680
不 不管你信不信
No, believe it or not,

1237
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,010
我没有想到我会
I did not think I would end up

1238
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,220
看上去就像一个有嘴的山药
looking like a yam with a mouth on it.

1239
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,600
但我们就在这儿
But here we are.

1240
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:52,020
这也会发生在你身上
It'll happen to you.

1241
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,230
你不会知道是什么击中了你
You won't know what hit you.

1242
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,700
我遇到了一件非常糟糕的事情
Something pretty bad happened to me,

1243
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,910
这可能就是我行为怪异的原因
so that's probably why I'm acting weird.

1244
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,120
有多糟糕？
How bad?

1245
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,290
一...
Um...

1246
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,910
我想真的很糟糕
I guess really bad.

1247
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,040
你不知道这很糟糕吗？
You don't know it's bad?

1248
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,590
不 我知道这很糟糕
No, I know it's bad.

1249
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:24,340
但主要是因为每当我告诉别人这件事时
But mainly because whenever I tell anyone about it,

1250
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,600
他们看起来真的为我感到害怕
they look really scared for me.

1251
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,350
除了我的朋友 但她搬走了
Except for my friend, but she moved away.

1252
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,520
有时候我一想到这件事就觉得难过
And then sometimes I feel bad when I think about it,

1253
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,560
因为...
because...

1254
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,440
我记得那些时刻
I remember moments of it,

1255
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:44,900
我可以感觉到我的身体
and I can feel in my body

1256
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,700
那真的很糟糕
that it was really bad.

1257
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,870
但有时我不会去想它
But then sometimes I don't think about it,

1258
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,040
这很奇怪
which is weird.

1259
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,670
当我不去想这件事时 我就会感到内疚
And I feel guilty when I don't think about it.

1260
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:01,920
刚刚发生的事吗？
Did it just happen?

1261
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,600
这就是你气喘吁吁的原因吗？
Is that why you were huffing and puffing?

1262
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,090
不 是三...
No, it was three...

1263
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,850
三年前
a little over three years ago.

1264
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:11,560
嗯 时间并不多
Well, that's not that much time.

1265
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,560
我的意思是 这需要很多时间
I mean, it's a lot of time,

1266
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,690
但时间也不多了
but it's not that much time, too.

1267
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,440
是的
Yeah.

1268
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:24,740
你是...
Are you...

1269
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,160
你家还好吗？
okay in your house?

1270
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,120
我有一只猫
I have a cat.

1271
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:33,540
好的
Okay.

1272
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,850
奥尔加 这到底是怎么回事？
Olga, what the fuck?

1273
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,770
奥尔加 去睡觉吧
Olga, go to bed.

1274
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,520
呃 奥尔加 你在我的床上拉屎了吗？
Ugh, Olga, did you shit in my bed?

1275
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,190
哦！奥尔加 这到底是怎么回事？

哦！一个包 一个包！我有一个包！
Oh! A bag, a bag! I got a bag!

Get in the bag.

1288

I'm so sorry.

1291
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,750

1295
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:30,320
艾格尼丝 你还好吗？
Agnes, are you okay?

1296
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,660
艾格尼丝？什么……
Agnes? What...

1297
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,280
你还好嗎？
Are you okay?

1298
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,080
你会来操我嗎？
Will you come fuck me?

1299
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,790
是的
Yes.

1300
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,500
等一下 等一下 我需要鞋子
Wait, wait. I need shoes.

1301
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,960
我嗯……我确实需要鞋子
I um... I do need shoes.

1302
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,380
一秒钟
One second.

1303
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,050
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

1304
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:14,130
我可以小便吗？
Can I pee?

1305
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,470
哦 是的 当然
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

1306
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,910
我可以进去吗？
Can I get in?

1307
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:45,000
哦 在洗澡吗？
Oh, in the bath?

1308
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,160
是的
Yeah.

1309
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,750
呃 当然
Uh, sure.

1310
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:59,260
我只是要在这里转一圈
I'm just gonna turn around here.

1311
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,470
别介意我
Don't mind me.

1312
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,390
你不必隐藏它
You don't have to hide it.

1313
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,020
现在还很小
It's small right now.

1314
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,520
男人真是奇怪
Men are so weird.

1315
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:11,310
谢谢
Thank you.

1316
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,610
噢 那太好了
Oh, that's nice.

1317
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,370
温度适宜
It's a good temperature.

1318
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:24,580
谢谢
Thank you.

1319
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,580
我对自己隐藏自己的阴茎感到很尴尬
I'm embarrassed that I was hiding my dick.

1320
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,460
没关系
That's okay.

1321
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,340
我把头发放在胸部上
I put my hair over my boobs.

1322
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:37,800
如此真实
So true.

1323
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,100
抱歉 浴缸太小了
I'm sorry the bathtub is so small.

1324
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,850
这个浴缸？
This bathtub?

1325
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,730
不 很好
No, it's good.

1326
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,940
如果我坐在你后面呢？
What if I sat behind you?

1327
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:00,570
—为什么？—那么 呃……
-Why? -So, uh...

1328
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,160
它可能就像一个拥抱
it could be like a hug.

1329
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,870
好的
Okay.

1330
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,450
-是啊是啊
-Yeah? -Yeah.

1331
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,630
哦 等等 我可以看看吗？
Oh, wait. Can I look at it?

1332
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,880
嗎？
At my dick?

1333
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:17,840
是的
Yeah.

1334
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:28,560
唔...
Hmm...

1335
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,890
我从未见过如此柔软的
I've never seen one that soft.

1336
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,980
好吧 我觉得那只是让我做了恶梦
Okay, I think that just gave me nightmares

1337
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,230
未来十年
for the next decade.

1338
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:37,110
不 我的意思是 你永远不可能看到他们那样
No, I mean, you just never get to see them like that.

1339
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,280
他们这样会更好
They're better like this.

1340
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:45,620
唔...
Hmm...

1341
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,160
好的 我说完了
Okay, I'm done.

1342
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:05,340
毫米
Mm.

1343
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:09,560
毫米
Mm.

1344
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:17,190
你以为你想要每个人都有的东西吗？
Do you think you want the stuff that everyone has?

1345
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,570
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

1346
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,150
就像 呃
Like, uh,

1347
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,990
家庭或者其他什么的 我不知道
family or whatever. I don't know.

1348
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,080
你想要那些东西吗？
Do you want that stuff?

1349
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,080
与你？
With you?

1350
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,160
不
No.

1351
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,870
不 我的意思是 这是你的问题
No, I mean, it was your question.

1352
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,540
是的 我想要那个东西
Yeah. I want that stuff.

1353
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,170
好的
Nice.

1354
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,550
你？
Do you?

1355
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,090
出色地...
Well...

1356
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,430
你知道 可能只是为了让 Lydie 更亲近一些……
You know, probably just to keep Lydie closer...

1357
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,640
但我没有看到
but I don't see it.

1358
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,060
在哪里看到？
See it where?

1359
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,400
就像在我的脑海里一样
Like, in my head.

1360
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:02,440
我不认为自己会变老或者有孩子
I don't see myself getting older or having kids.

1361
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:05,360
我看不到我自己
I don't see myself.

1362
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,490
我认为你会是一位伟大的妈妈
I think you'd be a great mom.

1363
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,870
为什么？
Why?

1364
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,250
您非常友善
You're very nice.

1365
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,340
我没那么好
I'm not that nice.

1366
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,300
人们总是说他们不想要孩子
People always say they don't want a kid,

1367
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,010
但后来情况发生了变化
but then things change.

1368
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,430
我们想要什么等等...
What we want and stuff...

1369
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,680
我认为它会改变
I think it changes.

1370
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:45,820
太冷了
It's too cold.

1371
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,200
我认为这很好
I think it's nice.

1372
01:28:05,588 --> 01:28:11,415

And now I know what an exploding vagina

1390

Fran, we're free! We're free.

1452
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:36,380
灯塔非常浪漫
The lighthouse is very romantic.

1453
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:38,640
你们两个应该单独在一起

1454

再生一个孩子或者其他什么的

大概二十分钟 就是这样
Like, twenty minutes, that's it.

1456
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,680
有一个问题 如果她杀了我怎么办？
One question. What if she kills me?

1457
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,190
她不会杀了你的

1458
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,070

1470
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:28,980
我该对她说什么呢？
What do I say to her?

1471
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,560
宝贝 你什么也不用说
Babe, you don't have to say anything.

1472
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,610
二十分钟
Twenty minutes.

1473
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,140
你好
Hi.

1474

我是艾格尼丝
I'm Agnes.

1475
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,400
很奇怪有一天你会成为一个人
Pretty weird you're gonna be a person someday.

1476
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:18,490
无意冒犯 但你现在看上去很疯狂
No offense, but you look insane right now.

1477
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,900
皮肤和少量毛发
Skin and just a small amount of hair.

1478
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,070
不用担心
Don't worry.

1479
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,790
不久之后就不会这样了
It won't be like that in a little.

1480
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:34,750
这样可以吗或者...
Is this okay or...

1481
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:50,640
好的
All right.

1482
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:53,350
我就把你放下来
I'll put you down.

1483
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,940
哦 我去接你
Oh. I'll pick you back up.

1484
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:56,940
好的 好的 好的
Okay, okay, okay.

1485
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:23,510
你看上去真甜美
You're so sweet looking.

1486
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:42,400
等你长大了 什么都可以告诉我
When you grow up, you can tell me whatever.

1487
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,200
比如 如果你有一个想法
Like, if you have a thought

1488
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:48,700
你会觉得这个想法很糟糕
and you're like, that's a bad thought,

1489
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:52,660
我可能也有同样的想法 但是
I probably had that same thought but, like,

1490
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:54,920
糟糕十倍
ten times worse.

1491
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,380
所以你直接告诉我就可以了
So you can just tell me.

1492
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:01,630
我永远不会被这个吓到
I'll never be scared by that.

1493
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,390
如果有人对你做了坏事……
If someone does something bad to you...

1494
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:13,060
如果有人说了一些可怕的事情......
If someone says something scary...

1495
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:17,980
如果你想自杀
If you wanna kill yourself

1496
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:20,480
用铅笔或者小刀或者其他什么东西
with like a pencil or a knife or whatever,

1497
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,740
你可以直接告诉我
you can just tell me.

1498
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:30,740
我永远不会告诉你你让我害怕
I'll never tell you you're scaring me.

1499
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:34,620
我只能说 是的
I'll just say, yeah.

1500
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:36,500
我知道
I know.

1501
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,330
有时候就是这样
It's just like that sometimes.

1502
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:41,800
是的
Yeah.

1503
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,720
对不起
I'm sorry

1504
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,930
不好的事情将会发生在你身上
that bad things are gonna happen to you.

1505
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,930
我希望他们不会
I hope they don't.

1506
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,690
如果我能阻止某件事变坏
If I can ever stop something from being bad,

1507
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:57,850
让我知道
let me know.

1508
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:03,480
但有时糟糕的事情就会发生
But sometimes bad stuff just happens.

1509
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,160
这就是为什么我为你感到难过
That's why I feel bad for you,

1510
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,240
在某种程度上
in a way.

1511
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:16,450
你还活着 但你还不知道这一点
That you're alive and you don't know that yet.

1512
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,170
但我仍然可以听
But I can still listen

1513
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:30,510
不要害怕
and not be scared.

1514
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,850
这很好
So that's good.

1515
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,310
或者至少是这样的
Or that's something, at least.
